LEYLA AND MECNUN

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.233
EPISODE 12

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.533
Take it away, man, for God's sake!

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.700
Eat it! It's compassionate to eat!

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.567
You killed the man, and you offer
me sweets after his funeral!

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:09.667
I don't want it!

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:15.533
I don't believe it! Did I kill him?
We killed him together!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.200
Are you to trying to implicate me?
I have the feeling you are

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.500
Don't talk nonsense.
We didn't kill anyone.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.700
It was an accident. He was pulling

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:28.633
the bag and then something happened...

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.500
Did you use enough chocolate
in the sweets?

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:33.133
I agree. I wish he hadn't pulled the bag
like that.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.800
My late grandma always warned me

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.067
when I did something like that, saying
"Don't do it, you can fall down."

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:37.800
He stuck to the bag like a child.
It was obvious he'd fall.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:43.300
Right? Of course it was.
We're not responsible

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.000
It's a user error, that's all.

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.167
The murderer is innocent, then?

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.267
Grandpa, why do you still say "murderer"?

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.267
Don't talk like that,
we could be arrested.

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:55.633
Listen to me,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.333
what about going to a Turkish bath
and soaking ourselves?

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:02.300
Erdal, God damn you! You're still
thinking about going to a Turkish bath!

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.800
Hold the camera and raise it like this,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.733
then take your own picture
in the reflection of that mirror.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.300
That way, the camera
will appear in the pictures.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.700
Then you can use it as a profile picture
or ID picture, whatever.

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:17.267
It's your choice.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:23.167
No, you got me wrong.
I just want a headshot.

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:30.200
Twelve-piece set or twenty-four piece set.
Student discount. Does it ring a bell?

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:33.633
Ok. If you want a headshot,
please be seated.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:46.233
Look at me. Yes, please look at me. Smile.

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:49.767
Smile a little more.
Look over here, a little to the left.

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:56.267
Raise your head a little. Ok.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:00.133
Move your hand. Ok.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.100
It's... It's not comfortable.

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:07.433
-You are not comfortable?
-Let's do it the old way. How about this?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.133
Okay.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.700
I'm taking your picture. Are you ready?

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:14.367
But please don't make any hand gestures.

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:15.733
What do you mean?

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:20.767
Sometimes the picture gets blurred
when the light flashes.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.133
You know what I mean.
Don't ask me to explain it now.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.400
Why would I do that? Like a grown up
child!

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:28.433
Let's take the shot, please.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.033
Look over here, lower your head. Okay.

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:38.533
That's it. Raise your head a bit.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.467
Raise your chin a little.

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:04.567
But we have a serious problem, a very
serious problem.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.400
-What it is?
-The sweets.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.433
It's a sloppy job. Not properly done.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.667
I don't think you added the right
quantities of the ingredients.

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:12.567
If you know better, why didn't you
do it yourself?

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:13.767
I swear I would have done it better.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.467
It would have melted the moment
it touched your lips.

00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:18.700
What are you guys talking about?
We're in serious trouble, honest.

00:05:19.067 --> 00:05:21.067
They must have found the corpse by now.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.700
What if they found it?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
What do you mean?

00:05:25.067 --> 00:05:28.500
-We didn't kill...
-Our fingerprints are all over him.

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:30.700
Yes, they can identify the killer by his
shoe prints...

00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:32.233
They could find us right away.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.400
Mecnun, we didn't kill him.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:39.500
He jumped! Maybe he had some problems.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.000
Okay dad, let's remember that.
Maybe you can say that in court.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.367
You'll say "We didn't push him,
he pushed himself."

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:51.433
Please don't talk like that,
for heaven's sake. l don't feel well.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.067
I'm too old to go to jail.
They don't allow you to survive in jail.

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:59.133
They don't allow!

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:19.200
As-salamu aleykum, brothers.

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:23.500
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam!

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.733
Leave those pussycats alone!

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:50.200
Mecnun, watch out for those tattooed guys.
They're sneaky types.

00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:53.400
They play tricks behind your back.

00:06:53.467 --> 00:06:56.500
What are you talking about? What do you
mean by tattooed men nowadays?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.533
Erdal, are you ok?

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.633
This is Turkey man, we don't have
such characters here.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.267
In Turkey, when you are sent to jail,
you play a local musical instrument,

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:08.167
that's all! You may be skewered
in the toilet but...

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:18.200
I have a splitting headache.
Thanks, brother!

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.467
My head. I think I'm dying!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.167
Elephants trampled down all the grass

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:30.000
while they were playing football
inside my head.

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:34.633
I am dying Erdal, give me a painkiller,
a soda, give me anything for God's sake!

00:07:34.733 --> 00:07:36.700
Ismail, are you okay?

00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:40.700
I'm not okay, Brother Iskender! I'm not!
What did I tell you just now?

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:42.433
Don't you listen to me?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.400
I have a kind of hangover,
my body, my head.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.733
It's like I have eaten a full
crate of grapes.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.633
Eating grapes is kind of heavy on your
stomach. You should eat figs, brother.

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:58.667
What do we have to lose other than
our figs, Yavuz?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.433
What?

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:04.367
I am in terrible shape! Terrible!
I don't feel good.

00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:08.067
What happened to the bag?
Did I deliver it?

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.767
I don't remember anything!

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800
What do you mean you don't remember?
Ahmet took the bag and left.

00:08:13.033 --> 00:08:14.067
Don't you remember?

00:08:14.267 --> 00:08:16.100
-Ahmet took the bag and left.
-Ahmet?

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:17.333
He took it and left.

00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:19.800
What do you mean Ahmet took the bag and
left? What about the bag's gizmo?

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:22.300
-He opened it and left.
-What do you mean he took the bag

00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:24.033
and left? What am I going to
tell the guys?

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.300
Why did he take my bag? Damn him that
scum bag, Ahmet!

00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:33.600
Don't speak ill of the deceased!
It's a sin!

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:34.733
Dead?

00:08:35.133 --> 00:08:39.033
Unfortunately. He's gone.
Sorry for our loss.

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:41.267
Is he dead?

00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:44.433
What a nice man he was.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.800
He was not able to complete
his self-improvement project.

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:49.433
What a nice man he was!

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.567
Are these sweets customarily offered
after a funeral?

00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:55.000
Give me some, it's compassionate to eat
those sweets.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.400
What a nice man he was.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.067
What should we drink with it?

00:08:58.133 --> 00:08:59.200
Tea, of course.

00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:04.067
The best tea in town is at Grocer Erdal's!
Grocer Erdal!

00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:06.433
Grocer Erdal!

00:09:07.233 --> 00:09:08.333
What are you doing?

00:09:08.467 --> 00:09:09.633
How did it happen?

00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:11.433
These guys killed him.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.767
Hodja, sir, you're kinda looking at me
as you say, "These guys killed him."

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:17.467
Is it me only?

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:20.367
Please, nobody should try to wriggle
out of this situation.

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:23.533
You're trying to trap me into it.
Please, Hodja sir. Please!

00:09:23.767 --> 00:09:26.133
I didn't kill him all by myself.
We killed him together!

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:29.133
How could you do this to that guy
who was trying to self-improve?

00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:32.033
How could you do this to a good man
like him?

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.000
What kind of people are you?
Why did you kill him?

00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:37.500
Ismail, he took your bag and left.

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:38.667
Would you have preferred
we not follow him?

00:09:38.733 --> 00:09:40.400
We did you a favor, but you don't
appreciate it!

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:44.233
Don't talk any more, Iskender.
Please don't.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.400
You killed the guy.

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:52.367
Please say no more.
Don't hurt me any more!

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:55.300
You killed the guy
who was trying to self-improve.

00:09:55.367 --> 00:09:56.733
Please don't hurt me anymore.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.733
I am in pain, I am in mourning.

00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:03.533
How does this work?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.200
I think I have to turn the key.
Okay, let's go.

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:10.567
May the blessings of God be upon you!

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.767
Did he use expired ether?

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:19.500
Do we need to check the construction site?

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:21.000
Maybe they haven't found the body yet.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.233
Nobody found the body?

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.800
How come no one has found the body yet?
Is it a wallet?

00:10:24.033 --> 00:10:25.367
That's a huge body lying there.

00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:27.733
Grandpa, what do you think?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.233
-What should we do?
-Me?

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:33.133
Me? You are talking nonsense and
eating sweets,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.667
and you are asking me now?

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:36.533
Grandpa you are being childish.

00:10:37.267 --> 00:10:39.433
You are a White-Bearded Grandpa,
a holy man. Why are you acting like this?

00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:42.433
You have a stick!

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.200
You get offended by everything.

00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:46.300
You make innuendos.

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:51.433
-Don't do it, please.
-Hey guys! What are you doing here?

00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:56.100
You are all here eating sweets.
Has someone died?

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:59.000
No, no. You have a stick, why...

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:00.733
-That thing, yes it's right.
-Let's do that thing.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.633
-Yes, that thing.
-Okay then, let's go.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.433
-Okay, let's do it. Let's go.
-Let's go that way.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.767
Wait a minute, what's happening here?
Brother Erdal? Where are you going?

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:17.433
Guys, where are you going?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.267
Why are you doing this?

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:23.167
Why are you getting rid of me?

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.500
Dad!

00:11:25.567 --> 00:11:26.767
CHESS FOR BEGINNERS

00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:30.000
I want Leyla!

00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:31.667
We're back to square one!

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.767
Yes, we're back to square one,
but this time I am absolutely sure

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:36.133
I can do everything to get her!

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:39.033
That's good! I like your attitude.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.100
Thank you, dad.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:44.567
That slap in the face proved to me that
I can't live without her.

00:11:44.633 --> 00:11:45.700
Did she slap you?

00:11:45.767 --> 00:11:52.133
Yes, but I don't think a man is a man
until a woman slaps him.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.567
Hasn't mom ever slapped you?

00:11:53.633 --> 00:11:55.233
That's not worth mentioning!

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:01.167
You know what, after that slap I realized
that all the women around me

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.000
are interested in me because I am a rich,
intelligent, and well-mannered man.

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:07.633
That's very nice.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.133
No dad! You don't understand.

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:14.200
Last night, I approached

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.733
a total stranger, only because
he looked like Leyla and I said "Hi!".

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:19.100
To a man?

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:20.333
Yes, to a man!

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.767
He looked like Leyla from a distance
but when I got closer

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.167
I saw he had a moustache and a beard.
It was disgusting.

00:12:25.233 --> 00:12:26.633
I barely saved my skin.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.433
Sit down! We can handle this matter.

00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:33.800
They keep on working as if nothing
had happened.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.467
Do you think they may have missed
the body?

00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:41.600
Nonsense, Grocer! How can they miss it?
He was lying there, all stretched out.

00:12:42.067 --> 00:12:44.433
So why do they keep on working
as if nothing has happened?

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.433
They have to keep working, brother.
The show must go on!

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:49.467
The night my dad passed away,
I also had worked.

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:51.100
I climbed nine stories with that sorrow
building up in me.

00:12:51.267 --> 00:12:55.667
Look here! We'll go to the nearest
police station and tell them everything.

00:12:55.733 --> 00:13:00.433
We'll say "It was an accident," "We're
sorry." and then have tea and leave.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.533
Grandpa, I think you should go home.
"We'll have tea." Come on Grandpa!

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.567
Mecnun, I don't think this is going to
work. Let's go inside and look around.

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:17.033
I am a little scared.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:23.200
There is a sign on the board that says,
"Come in, if you've got the balls!"

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:26.100
What's the worst that could happen?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.333
Come on, let's go.

00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:34.367
What will happen now?

00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:38.500
Is it really dangerous to go
to the construction site?

00:13:39.433 --> 00:13:41.133
Is it dangerous and prohibited?

00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:44.467
Stop! Turn!

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:48.300
Now! Let's go!

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.500
Stop!

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:03.067
I have a plan but...

00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:05.100
-What?
-They're standing there, right?

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:08.367
-I think...
-Yeah?

00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:13.333
What's happening here? Tell me
what's happening.

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:17.133
Mecnun, how much do you think these
apartments cost? Can we afford them?

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:18.400
Too expensive.

00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:20.367
These are brand new apartments.
The price is normal.

00:14:20.433 --> 00:14:23.733
That's not the issue, if we pay now,
it won't be so expensive.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.167
Yes.

00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:28.600
We've come here at the wrong time. All the
apartments should be sold out already.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.100
Let's go guys. Let's go.

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:31.800
Okay Kamil, see you later.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.700
Where are you going?
We're all from the same neighborhood.

00:14:36.767 --> 00:14:39.033
Why are you getting rid of me?
That's not nice.

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:40.667
Brother!

00:14:40.733 --> 00:14:42.467
Listen Metin, Arda wants Leyla.

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:44.600
Yes, I want her!

00:14:45.033 --> 00:14:48.167
Persuade her! Don't discourage him.

00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:52.267
I am so bored! Finally I will organize
a celebration and invite everybody.

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:56.733
And then I will arrange contests and offer
my daughter's hand to the winner.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.433
What are you talking about, Metin?

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.233
What are you saying, mister?
I see you more often than I see my wife.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.567
I am always here, thanks to you.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.500
I can't even go to work because of you.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.233
If that's what she wants, what can I do?

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.467
Metin! Are you aware
whom you are talking to?

00:15:11.533 --> 00:15:13.500
Are you aware whom you are talking to?

00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:15.600
Yes, I am aware, mister! Don't worry!

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.633
But that's all I can do.

00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:20.000
Please don't call me again
about this matter.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.567
Well! Good luck!

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.333
He kicked you in the butt!

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.200
I will finish him off.

00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:30.533
He will regret what he said! First...

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.600
Okay, dad. Let it go.

00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:36.667
But he said he would organize contests.
Do you think he was serious?

00:15:36.733 --> 00:15:38.467
Even if he was, I'm sure I will win.

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:42.400
Actually if it requires intelligence
I can't do it, but if it's about sports,

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:43.767
I'll certainly succeed.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.433
What happened? Why do you have
that kind of look?

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:51.267
Do you think Ismail can handle the task?

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.700
Why can't he brother?

00:15:52.767 --> 00:15:54.567
He will enter the building
and just look around a bit, that's all!

00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:56.200
Only if he gets the job.

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:06.167
He's already got it!

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.400
I hope he does it fast.
I closed the store.

00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:14.467
He will be fast. It's okay. He'll just
look around a bit, that's all!

00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:15.700
Hopefully.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.667
What is Ismail doing inside anyway?

00:16:17.733 --> 00:16:20.133
He went in to...

00:16:20.733 --> 00:16:22.167
Kamil is here. Let's go!

00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:24.567
What's happening? What are you up to?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.400
I will show you what it means to
get rid of Kamil! Here's the motorcycle!

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.567
Leyla! It is you, right?

00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:43.533
You don't have a moustache. Yes, it's you.

00:16:43.733 --> 00:16:45.633
For a moment I thought you were
the guy with a moustache.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.567
I thought I was in trouble again.

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:51.367
Me? A guy with a moustache?
Arda, are you ok?

00:16:51.433 --> 00:16:56.767
No, no I am not okay. I'm an evil person.
I have evilness in my genes.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.300
I have evilness here, and here.
I have evilness flowing all over me.

00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:07.333
Actually, I'm a bad guy.
Actually, that's exciting!

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:11.800
Leyla! Where are you going Leyla?

00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:16.200
I am a villain. I could throw a stone
and give you a black eye.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.200
Were you also sent to the players' bench,
man?

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:23.000
No, I was ordered directly off the field.

00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.000
Do you want me to help you?

00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:28.400
Why? Do you also have evil genes?

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:32.200
I don't know. But I have a crazy look!

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.433
That's good. How are you going to help me?

00:17:35.633 --> 00:17:37.567
So, they're up to something?

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:40.400
Yes, exactly!
They don't generally act like this.

00:17:40.633 --> 00:17:42.433
There's something fishy going on.

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.333
Why are you betraying your friends?

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:47.500
Friends? Whose friends?

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.467
They always get rid of me.

00:17:50.633 --> 00:17:55.000
I want to leave a mark in this life.
That's enough!

00:17:55.267 --> 00:17:57.433
Well! I like ambitious men.

00:17:57.733 --> 00:18:00.500
If they are both ambitious and evil,
I like them all the more.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.433
Follow Mecnun and his friends
at all times.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.367
Go after them, but don't let them see you.

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:08.667
Take pictures secretly.
I wonder what they are up to.

00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:09.800
Yes sir!

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.233
Everyone has left the building
except Ismail. Where is he?

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:22.200
Where is he, really?

00:18:22.333 --> 00:18:25.667
We are exposed here!
Standing like Ismail's parents.

00:18:42.133 --> 00:18:47.100
There is no cure for my pain

00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:52.267
I feel blue and miserable

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.100
Brother Ismail!

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:58.067
-What are you doing?
-Earning my bread and butter, Mecnun!

00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:02.200
Brother, we sent you inside to
look around. Did you get a job?

00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:03.567
Where is the body?

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.600
I secretly asked the guys working here,
but there is nothing.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:15.133
I want to ask you something. Did you
recently see something interesting?

00:19:15.767 --> 00:19:17.100
How interesting?

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.200
I don't know. For example did you see
a korps?

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:29.700
For God's sake, Brother Ismail! Did you
ask those men about the corpse?

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.567
I didn't say corpse!
Why are you asking me this, am I a moron?

00:19:34.633 --> 00:19:39.300
-Don't you know me? I said korps, korps!
-What is a korps?

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.567
It means man who is not entirely dead.
I used that word especially

00:19:45.633 --> 00:19:48.300
to get them confused. What's the plan?

00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:51.333
Dad, let's look around.

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:56.200
I can't come with you, Mecnun.
I'm very busy.

00:19:56.267 --> 00:19:58.200
in two weeks.

00:19:58.267 --> 00:20:01.067
Is it possible to finish this work in
two weeks? Is it reasonable?

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:03.800
Ismail, you don't have your bag.

00:20:04.033 --> 00:20:05.300
Yes.

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:09.067
Ismail, if we don't find the bag,
they will find you.

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:12.767
What can I do?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.400
Let's say they found me. It's not worth
breaking one's heart for a bag.

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:20.067
No, they don't break your heart.
They break your skull.

00:20:20.133 --> 00:20:23.400
What are you talking about!
For God's sake Grandpa, he's scaring me!

00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:25.633
They don't break your skull.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.600
They break each and every single
bone in your body.

00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:32.267
You say they will break something
in any case!

00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:05.700
Guys, the place is clear.

00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:07.433
Outside is clear too.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.167
Does anyone sees anything?
Where is this corpse?

00:21:10.233 --> 00:21:12.433
What if someone buried him
to do a good deed?

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.533
That's absolute nonsense!

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.567
Erdal, you've become
a frequent bullshitter! Don't do that!

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.200
Why are you talking like that!
It was just a thought. I thought out loud.

00:21:25.267 --> 00:21:28.700
Do not think, Erdal. Why are you thinking?
Skip that process. Just freeze.

00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:35.733
Come on! Why are you treating me as
the weakest link in the chain?

00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:40.500
I'm aware that you all are going to
set me up! I know it!

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.667
Brother Erdal, what an inappropriate
gesture that is! Is that proper?

00:21:44.767 --> 00:21:49.667
-What do you mean a "link"?
-You are talking nonsense, gibberish!

00:21:49.733 --> 00:21:56.067
I am already dead! They will break
my bones for that bag but you are still...

00:21:56.133 --> 00:21:59.500
No, they won't. I caused all of this, so
I am going to solve everything.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.567
I have a plan.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.167
What plan?

00:22:04.467 --> 00:22:11.433
Frankly speaking, I always prefer
to speak frankly.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.667
I appreciate sincerity.

00:22:13.733 --> 00:22:16.667
Sincerity is important in the
business world.

00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:21.033
Yes you are right.
We couldn't deliver your bag.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.167
When you said 22 hours 22 minutes
I got confused already.

00:22:24.267 --> 00:22:27.167
So, here is your bag.

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:30.000
What the hell is that? Are you kidding me?

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.500
Never! It's not my style.

00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:34.267
I always appreciate sincerity
in the business world.

00:22:34.633 --> 00:22:38.133
Screw your business world!
Where did you find this bag?

00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:43.533
Help! A thief!

00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:46.633
Am I such a person? Shame on you!

00:22:50.033 --> 00:22:52.033
What about my bag?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.400
If only we also knew where that bag was.

00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:58.500
This is also a nice bag. It's chic.

00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:02.533
It has style. It's real Bengal tiger.
Waterproof.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.800
You are still making fun of me!

00:23:05.567 --> 00:23:07.733
Recai, what do you think,
should I shoot him?

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.500
It's up to you, boss.

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:11.300
If you are going to shoot,
let's take him outside.

00:23:11.367 --> 00:23:13.333
-It's always hard to clean the floor.
-What?!

00:23:14.533 --> 00:23:19.400
They're talking about shooting.
What about breaking bones?

00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:22.667
What kind of an organization is that?
What kind of a plan is that, Yavuz?

00:23:22.733 --> 00:23:24.200
-Wait a second!
-Listen to me!

00:23:25.233 --> 00:23:29.300
You stay here and say you will bring that
bag from the place where you hid it!

00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:31.433
Or else, your friend will be dead!

00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:35.033
What are you talking about?
If I knew where the bag was,

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.367
I would definitely bring it back.

00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:39.033
Find it and bring it.

00:23:39.133 --> 00:23:41.500
You have 23 hours and 23 minutes.

00:23:41.667 --> 00:23:43.800
What do you mean 23-23?

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.067
Do you have to be so precise?
Let's say 24 hours.

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:49.100
No! I have my own plans!

00:23:49.167 --> 00:23:50.600
What the hell!

00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:54.433
Darling, what's going on?
What's with the long face?

00:23:54.567 --> 00:23:56.200
Nothing, I'm fine.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.500
Should I tell her?

00:23:57.567 --> 00:24:00.700
Grandpa, please be silent!
For God's sake!

00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:05.200
I don't believe it!

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.067
Look at what she has done,
and in our cafe!

00:24:08.367 --> 00:24:09.600
Is it your cafe?

00:24:09.733 --> 00:24:10.733
No we don't own it.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.200
We were going to get engaged here,

00:24:13.267 --> 00:24:16.600
but this scum bag came with a horse
and confused her.

00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:19.233
If it wasn't for the horse,
we would have been engaged.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.400
-But the horse confused Leyla.
-He came on a horse!

00:24:25.133 --> 00:24:27.667
What are you still doing? They're just
sitting. Why are you taking more pictures?

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:33.133
Then, let me go to the neighborhood and
follow the others!

00:24:33.233 --> 00:24:34.600
Ok, suit yourself.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.800
-Ok, I'm leaving.
-Ok.

00:24:39.467 --> 00:24:40.667
This is for you.

00:24:41.433 --> 00:24:42.433
What is this?

00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:44.067
It's my headshot.

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:46.167
Your headshot?

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.600
What am I to do with your headshot, Leyla?
Am I from the local government?

00:24:50.467 --> 00:24:56.533
I thought, maybe you would like to put it
in your wallet. Everybody does that.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.767
Do they?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.267
Yes, they do.

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.133
Do you want my picture?

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:10.333
They're exchanging headshots.
What miserable creatures they are!

00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:18.067
I'm so ugly, right?

00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:23.233
-So cute! But you've changed a lot.
-Your face has changed, don't lie.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.333
You've changed a lot.
This doesn't look like you.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.200
Of course I've changed.
I've become all together another person.

00:25:28.267 --> 00:25:29.567
Do I look like that?

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.600
Let's go, Grandpa.

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:39.300
I can't go anywhere. The girls are coming.
I have to wait for them.

00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:43.500
Are you going to wait for the girls?
We have to go, but you can stay.

00:25:43.633 --> 00:25:45.333
See you later.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.467
Son, what's happening to you?
Why did you act like that?

00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:57.767
What is it? Grandpa, please
don't get on to me! I feel blue.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.167
Why don't you tell Leyla everything?

00:26:01.367 --> 00:26:02.433
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.167
I should tell her everything.

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:06.567
Leyla, I am a murderer.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.000
Actually, I can't be defined as a murderer
since it was an accident

00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:16.533
Also, I wasn't by myself. It was teamwork.

00:26:17.567 --> 00:26:21.100
What really matters is not my being
a killer but my team's success.

00:26:21.333 --> 00:26:22.667
Yes, I have a team.

00:26:23.533 --> 00:26:25.333
Can you guess its name?

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.000
"Natural Born Killers".

00:26:29.267 --> 00:26:30.733
It could work.

00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:34.633
Actually it's cool. I'm not sure.

00:26:37.167 --> 00:26:38.367
I don't know.

00:26:46.167 --> 00:26:47.500
What's he doing here?

00:26:47.567 --> 00:26:49.500
Oh, what's up, man?

00:26:50.467 --> 00:26:51.800
What are you doing here?

00:26:52.133 --> 00:26:54.733
I'm going to buy a waterfront mansion,
so I am trying to choose which one.

00:26:55.067 --> 00:26:57.100
You are a bizarre man.

00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:58.767
It's all because of my hair.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.600
Why don't you stop following her, mate?
You have become a laughing stock here.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.767
-Have I?
-You have! Shame on you!

00:27:07.033 --> 00:27:12.767
Don't do it anymore. You are a young man.
Stop following her.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.467
I have a suggestion for you.
Let's go to my mom.

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:20.000
-She has got a thick catalogue of girls.
-Are you serious?

00:27:20.167 --> 00:27:24.233
She collected all of them over the years.
Let's look at them.

00:27:24.367 --> 00:27:26.267
It's not necessary.

00:27:26.367 --> 00:27:28.400
-I can handle it myself.
-Why bother?

00:27:28.533 --> 00:27:30.067
For example...

00:27:31.767 --> 00:27:35.167
Excuse me beautiful lady,
have we slept together?

00:27:35.467 --> 00:27:37.467
How is your head? Does it hurt too much?

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.433
Yes it does. It hurts too much.
What are they carrying in their bags?

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.633
I don't know.

00:27:42.767 --> 00:27:45.300
Never make assumptions about what they are
carrying in their bags,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.167
you should be prepared for everything.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.667
Let's say she had
every right to punch me,

00:27:49.733 --> 00:27:52.400
-why did you also punch?
-You can't do that!

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:54.433
You can't say such words to a lady!

00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:01.300
You should be a gentleman towards a woman.
You should be a serious man.

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:05.033
-Do I make myself clear?
-Yes you do.

00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:07.200
Actually my approach to her was
quite cute.

00:28:07.267 --> 00:28:09.733
It worked before. I don't understand
what went wrong this time.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.633
Brother, your situation is worse
than mine.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.300
You should learn how to speak to a lady.
Learn how to be polite.

00:28:15.533 --> 00:28:17.633
They are women. You should know
these things.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.200
Do you need help?

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:22.233
Do you want Grandpa for a little bit?
Do you know how to use him?

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:26.467
Grandpa. Are you going to be our Grandpa?
Coochie, coochie coo.

00:28:26.533 --> 00:28:27.633
Get your hands off!

00:28:28.167 --> 00:28:31.400
If you treat me like a child, I will
beat you with this stick!

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.700
He's so shy.

00:28:33.067 --> 00:28:36.433
Nuts! Six of one and half a dozen of
the other!

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:47.300
It's too hard. After a certain age,
they turn into a child. It's really hard.

00:28:47.467 --> 00:28:51.000
He's so touchy. You know...

00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:53.267
Do you think the Earth will be the same?

00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:54.333
How?

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.500
I mean humankind has come from a
primitive age to this hi-tech age,

00:28:58.567 --> 00:28:59.733
and from this point

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:04.500
are we going to go backwards?
Just like old people becoming children?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.167
Do you hear yourself?

00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:09.200
Why, am I wrong? Listen to me, I'm going
to tell you something.

00:29:09.267 --> 00:29:11.133
I'm so unhappy, do you know that, Mecnun?

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:16.567
I have all the money in the world
but I'm still unhappy. I can't be happy.

00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:20.567
-Your life is harsh.
-Yes it is.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.233
Don't try to find happiness.
It's just a moment in life. A moment.

00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:27.700
Take that moment and the rest is trash.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.700
It's true.

00:29:31.033 --> 00:29:34.500
You know what, take this. Take it.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600
What is that?

00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:38.567
It's money. Maybe you'll be happy
for a moment.

00:29:38.633 --> 00:29:41.333
Brother, why are you giving me that?
How much is there anyway?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.600
I don't know, man. It comes pre-packaged
from the bank.

00:29:44.133 --> 00:29:45.200
-Honestly?
-Honestly.

00:29:45.467 --> 00:29:46.600
No kidding!

00:29:50.467 --> 00:29:52.400
Brother, I hate you.

00:29:52.567 --> 00:29:54.233
I am evil, brother. I have it in my genes.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.333
But it's not a good thing.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.233
I know, but I can't help it.
I inherited it from my father.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.800
-I understand.
-Let's break up peacefully.

00:30:22.167 --> 00:30:25.300
I see dead people!

00:30:25.667 --> 00:30:28.267
What is that! What's happening here?

00:30:28.367 --> 00:30:30.533
Am I seeing a ghost now? Are you a ghost?

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:32.267
Easy, easy! Don't shout at me!

00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:35.200
It's not what you think, I'm here
to help you.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.733
-To help me?
-Yes.

00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:38.233
What kind of help?

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:41.767
I think you should confess everything.
In the end, you didn't kill that guy.

00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:43.533
That guy?

00:30:44.033 --> 00:30:45.367
That guy?

00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:48.667
Grandpa, is it you?

00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:50.267
Grandpa?

00:30:50.533 --> 00:30:54.033
No, I'm not your Grandpa.
I'm your conscience.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.267
My conscience.

00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:57.133
Wonderful!

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.767
-I am here to make you suffer.
-This is good. Wonderful.

00:31:00.133 --> 00:31:01.433
I have gone completely mad.

00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:05.233
I think, you shouldn't be afraid of me.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.300
No way! Why should I be afraid of you?
It has become boring.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.067
If you'll be here for a long time,

00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:13.067
you can't sleep there
because it is Grandpa's place.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.200
This is mine, but if you like
we can share it.

00:31:17.267 --> 00:31:19.233
This is the only problem.

00:31:20.733 --> 00:31:23.233
-You're standing, why don't you sit down?
-Thanks!

00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:26.767
Mecnun!

00:31:27.167 --> 00:31:30.367
We are gathered at Brother Erdal's place.
We need to talk. Come on!

00:31:30.433 --> 00:31:32.733
Brother, I am coming but first
I want to ask you a question.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.467
-Ok ask.
-Do you see anyone besides me?

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:39.800
-No.
-No?

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.067
I think you should open the curtain,
it may be blocking your vision.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.200
No.

00:31:46.267 --> 00:31:48.567
Really? Do you see?

00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:50.633
Anyway brother, thank you.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.800
-Let's go!
-I'm coming in a minute.

00:31:53.067 --> 00:31:54.767
-Let's go brother!
-I'm coming in a minute.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.600
-Gosh!
-This is serious.

00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:04.733
I said to him "Listen to me mister! Who do
you think you are? You can't force me!"

00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:09.133
And then "I'm sick and tired of your
threatening attitude, get off my tail."

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.333
Well-said!

00:32:11.567 --> 00:32:15.600
I was going to curse but then
I thought it wasn't worth it.

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.567
Don't you think he's going to
mess with us?

00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:19.767
What can he do?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.667
He can threaten to evict us from his home.
He can ask you to pay your debts.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.233
He can sabotage your business.
He can even send you to jail.

00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:28.167
Jail?

00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:40.500
As-salamu aleykum, brother.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.500
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam!

00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:46.333
Does he do that?

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.500
No, I don't believe he does.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.033
Wow!

00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:10.233
Poor Ismail.

00:33:10.333 --> 00:33:12.733
He was a loser,
but still he was a good guy.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.300
Erdal, if you want, you can prepare sweets
to offer after his funeral.

00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:19.033
I think we should wait for the morning.

00:33:19.333 --> 00:33:23.033
Silence, for God's sake! We're trying
to talk about what we can do.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.167
Let's think about what we are going to do!

00:33:25.367 --> 00:33:28.533
They have Ismail. We have to
find that bag.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.733
We're running out of time.

00:33:32.133 --> 00:33:35.467
I can't imagine how they are
torturing him right now.

00:33:35.567 --> 00:33:36.633
Pity on him!

00:33:37.167 --> 00:33:40.467
-Do you think I am a moron?
-No! I can't handle this kind of torture.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.767
Please kill me! Shoot me!

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:47.433
That bracelet is fake, Kamil.

00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:49.200
Please kill me!

00:33:50.367 --> 00:33:53.633
This is the third domestic comedy series
you have made me watch!

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.067
These are not funny at all!
I can't breathe.

00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:59.333
I can't take it anymore!
Kill me! kill me now!

00:33:59.467 --> 00:34:02.033
Recai, take him to his room.

00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:04.333
He ruined my only TV pleasure.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.300
Actually these productions are
socially beneficial and funny.

00:34:08.367 --> 00:34:13.033
Thank you! May God bless you! Please lock
me in that room and keep me there.

00:34:13.633 --> 00:34:20.300
Maybe they're torturing him with a mangle
or electrifying him or maybe...

00:34:20.367 --> 00:34:24.233
Erdal go fetch us something to drink.
Erdal, hurry!

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.300
Ok, what do you want to drink?

00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:27.433
Tea, of course!

00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:34.000
The best tea in town is at Grocer Erdal's!
Grocer Erdal's!

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.800
I think we can solve the problem
with the replica of the bag.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.100
How?

00:34:40.167 --> 00:34:41.233
-Bag...
-Bag...

00:34:41.533 --> 00:34:45.167
Dad, do you know what's inside the bag?
It is useless to find a replica of it.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.067
Yes, you're right.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.400
Why does everything happen to us?

00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:53.200
It's because of me!

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.167
How did the guy fool me?

00:34:55.233 --> 00:34:57.767
Don't blame yourself!
You are only human after all.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.233
We can't know if it's good or bad.
Don't upset yourself.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.733
Don't say we!

00:35:04.167 --> 00:35:07.300
I was aware of that guy
from the very beginning.

00:35:07.367 --> 00:35:12.733
Well done, Grandpa! Congratulations!
You're one in a million!

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.633
Then, please show us
how to get out of this situation.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.000
Listen to me carefully.

00:35:17.167 --> 00:35:18.500
What did Ismail tell us
on the construction site?

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:23.333
He told us the foreman wants to finish
the job in two weeks, am I right?

00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:24.467
So?

00:35:24.733 --> 00:35:29.067
If the police finds a corpse there, the
construction will be slowed down, right?

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.733
In this situation, it's possible that
they buried the body if they found it.

00:35:38.767 --> 00:35:39.767
What about the bag?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.100
I don't have a clue about that.
We also can't ask those men.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.800
Do you know what we are supposed to do?

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.133
First we should go to the construction
site and search for the body.

00:35:49.267 --> 00:35:56.233
If we find it, it means
one of the workers has the bag.

00:36:01.667 --> 00:36:03.633
So, what are we going to do?

00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:07.600
What do you mean, what are we going to do?

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.700
We're going to search
the construction site.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.167
If we find the body, we find the bag.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.433
God bless you, Grandpa! Let's go!

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.767
-Are we going?
-We are going!

00:36:16.067 --> 00:36:18.467
Oh, Grandpa! You are really
one in a million!

00:36:18.533 --> 00:36:20.000
Are we going to the construction site
at night?

00:36:20.133 --> 00:36:21.600
Come on, hurry up!

00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:23.733
Where are you going? What about tea?

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200
We are going to the construction site.

00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:26.267
What are we going to do
on the construction site?

00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:28.667
-We are going to look for the body.
-We were there just this morning.

00:36:28.733 --> 00:36:29.733
There were no corpses.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.433
We're going to dig, Erdal.

00:36:32.133 --> 00:36:37.100
Grandpa said that someone among the
workers may have buried the corpse.

00:36:37.467 --> 00:36:38.567
Said him, said Grandpa!

00:36:38.633 --> 00:36:43.400
He said, they may have buried it.

00:36:43.767 --> 00:36:45.033
How?

00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:49.133
I said this. I said this
while we were there.

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:52.167
I said "Maybe someone buried him
as a good deed".

00:36:52.767 --> 00:36:56.533
You told me not to bullshit!
Grandpa said that?

00:36:57.167 --> 00:36:59.000
-Erdal...
-Shame on you!

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.567
He's stealing my idea!

00:37:01.633 --> 00:37:07.267
Erdal, there's a problem with your style.
Yes, you can find an idea, but that's all!

00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:12.333
You don't follow the idea, you impose it.

00:37:13.133 --> 00:37:18.067
For heaven's sake, Iskender, come on!
You didn't even listen to me there.

00:37:18.133 --> 00:37:20.300
But when he proposes the same thing,
you all follow him.

00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:22.500
Don't you see his beard?
He's got a beard!

00:37:22.567 --> 00:37:26.033
He has persuasive skills!
Brother, he has a stick!

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.667
What else would you ask for?

00:37:28.767 --> 00:37:32.367
You need to dig all the way from here
to there! From here to way out there!

00:37:33.367 --> 00:37:35.300
Hodja, we're already digging!
Don't you see?

00:37:36.233 --> 00:37:38.100
Don't push Grandpa's buttons!
Shame on you!

00:37:40.567 --> 00:37:46.167
Iskender, it offends me!
He both steals my ideas and gives orders.

00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:47.733
Why doesn't he dig anyway?

00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:49.567
He's an old man, Erdal.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.700
It's not here. I swear it's not here.

00:37:57.067 --> 00:37:59.633
My back is not good. I swear it's not
here. We have been digging for hours!

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.500
We will dig, brother!

00:38:01.567 --> 00:38:06.367
They could shoot Ismail
if we don't deliver the bag on time.

00:38:06.733 --> 00:38:10.633
I understand, but it isn't here!

00:38:11.133 --> 00:38:14.000
Are we going to dig up the entire field?

00:38:14.067 --> 00:38:16.600
If we have to dig it up, we will!

00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:20.400
Ok brother, you can leave!
I will dig all alone!

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:21.533
For Ismail!

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.500
He says that for Ismail!
Since when are you so close to him?

00:38:28.667 --> 00:38:34.267
If anybody sees us with the body,
we will be arrested for sure.

00:38:35.033 --> 00:38:36.400
We can't even justify ourselves.

00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:42.100
I hope we can manage to break out
of the prison.

00:39:34.567 --> 00:39:39.333
SEN BROTHERS PROUDLY PRESENT
DASLI GALA

00:40:35.667 --> 00:40:37.200
Gosh!

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.367
Erdal,

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.133
you don't have the foggiest idea
about a prison, right?

00:40:42.467 --> 00:40:45.667
Erdal, why Dasli Gala?

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.200
Dasli Gala?

00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:48.767
That makes no sense.

00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:51.633
We managed to escape from jail

00:40:51.767 --> 00:40:55.033
but we're still wearing the same clothes
while we're singing on that hill.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.400
Everything is reasonable so far, but only
that part bothers you. Interesting!

00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:03.333
We escaped from jail,
we sang Dasli Gala, brother.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.233
He is talking about taking us
to the top of a mountain wearing pajamas.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.700
For God's sake, what are we doing here?

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:13.500
We're digging graves in the middle
of the night on a construction site!

00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:18.100
If anyone sees us, they'll think
we're burying somebody!

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.433
There's a corpse
on the construction site. Corpse!

00:41:22.167 --> 00:41:24.600
A corpse? Are you sure?

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:26.333
I'm sure, boss!

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.067
He said they're looking for a corpse.

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:33.000
They dug all around the construction site.
I took their pictures.

00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:34.367
That's it!

00:41:34.433 --> 00:41:37.633
We show those pictures to Leyla, and
she ruins Mecnun! How is that for a plan?

00:41:40.733 --> 00:41:45.067
Okay brother! Don't look at me
like that! You are scaring me!

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.367
Easy boss! Let it go!

00:41:58.133 --> 00:42:04.133
Brother, at least one of you stays
with me. I'm afraid to be by myself!

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.067
I swear I'm very scared to be here
by myself. I can't sleep alone.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.700
Brother!

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:15.067
Brother! At least you can give me
a pair of pajamas.

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:17.033
I can't sleep in these clothes.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.467
Who am I talking to?

00:42:23.067 --> 00:42:24.100
Brother!

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.233
She's beautiful.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.000
Yes, she's beautiful.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.767
Are you going to stand by my side
every night?

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:40.567
That's kind of what I do.

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:45.067
You shouldn't sleep well
when you go to bed.

00:42:45.633 --> 00:42:50.500
You know, I am your conscience.
I shouldn't let you sleep all night.

00:42:56.167 --> 00:42:57.467
Good heavens!

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.300
Let's watch some TV.

00:43:04.167 --> 00:43:05.200
What do you want?

00:43:05.267 --> 00:43:07.233
I don't know. We'll find something.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.767
Turn it on.

00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:19.567
Look at that table!

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.800
My wife and daughter have
prepared breakfast for me.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.400
That's life!

00:43:27.267 --> 00:43:31.167
Sevim, do you think it is time to
retire and take care of the garden?

00:43:32.067 --> 00:43:33.333
Metin! What a brilliant idea!

00:43:33.533 --> 00:43:36.500
You'll plant some vegetables, and
we'll have a healthy diet.

00:43:36.567 --> 00:43:39.267
They inject hormones into everything
in the farmers' markets.

00:43:39.333 --> 00:43:41.000
Besides, they are so expensive.

00:43:44.633 --> 00:43:49.600
She takes everything seriously.
As if she goes to the farmers' market!

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.167
She's funny!

00:43:53.033 --> 00:43:56.133
Look at what he's doing!

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.367
-Good morning, have a nice breakfast.
-Thank you.

00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:00.100
What are these?

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.633
Mecnun and his friends' excavation work.

00:44:03.767 --> 00:44:06.533
They're burying the man
they killed.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.633
Which one is Mecnun?

00:44:10.133 --> 00:44:12.733
-This one is Mecnun. Isn't he?
-No, he isn't.

00:44:13.267 --> 00:44:18.167
I think this one. No, this one is Mecnun.

00:44:19.367 --> 00:44:21.633
No, it's White-Bearded Grandpa.
It is white beard.

00:44:23.433 --> 00:44:25.300
We have clearer ones.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.300
Brother, what is this?

00:44:29.467 --> 00:44:31.633
For God's sake, what is this?

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.333
It was just a mistake.
Let me take it, then.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.333
Take these too.

00:44:36.567 --> 00:44:38.100
We're trying to have our breakfast.
Please leave us alone.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.500
Let me tell you something.

00:44:39.567 --> 00:44:42.067
Did you ever think about why there is
never a woman with Mecnun?

00:44:42.133 --> 00:44:45.467
A man spends time with women.
Am I right, Uncle Metin?

00:44:45.533 --> 00:44:50.100
Yes you are right.
When I was young, I was full of vigor...

00:44:52.467 --> 00:44:54.500
Yes, you are right.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.167
You see? I am right.

00:44:57.233 --> 00:44:59.400
There are no women beside him.
Why? Because he is a murderer.

00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:04.133
Maybe he is kidnapping and killing them.
He could be a killer like Jack the Ripper.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.600
Butter knife didn't fit here, right?

00:45:44.267 --> 00:45:45.400
How?

00:45:46.067 --> 00:45:47.367
Never mind!

00:45:51.167 --> 00:45:54.333
You may think so.
But don't assume it's so in this case.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.733
This one is small. It's not
very effective.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.767
Do you have any bigger knives?

00:45:59.133 --> 00:46:00.500
They are more effective.

00:46:44.567 --> 00:46:46.200
Where are you going?

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:53.067
I am looking for the bus terminal.
Do you know where it is?

00:46:53.433 --> 00:46:54.800
What are you talking about? Get inside!

00:46:55.033 --> 00:46:59.467
What do you mean, "get inside"?
You've confused me with someone else.

00:46:59.733 --> 00:47:01.267
Get inside or I'll shoot you!

00:47:01.733 --> 00:47:07.567
You didn't believe it, right?
My voice has the right tone.

00:47:07.633 --> 00:47:12.800
Confused me, confusing me.
I cannot pronounce the word!

00:47:13.467 --> 00:47:17.233
What did you buy? Tomatoes!
There are eggs in the kitchen.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.267
Let me make you an omelet! Come on!

00:47:19.367 --> 00:47:21.100
-Go in.
-Come on!

00:47:21.633 --> 00:47:23.133
Come on!

00:47:36.567 --> 00:47:37.800
What's going on, Yavuz?

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:44.233
I'm thinking about Ismail all the time.
I couldn't stay at home.

00:47:44.433 --> 00:47:45.767
Same here!

00:47:48.033 --> 00:47:50.000
How are we going to save him?

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:53.667
I thought about it all night long.
I couldn't sleep.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.667
I slept through the night easily.

00:47:57.233 --> 00:48:02.367
I was aching all over my body
because we kept digging all night.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.600
I was exhausted and slept like a log.

00:48:06.033 --> 00:48:07.800
We need to exercise, Yavuz, exercise!

00:48:08.033 --> 00:48:09.667
Brother Erdal are you serious?

00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:15.033
Why are you talking like that, Yavuz?
Am I wrong, don't we need to exercise?

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.500
If you don't exercise, you become...

00:48:16.567 --> 00:48:18.267
-The Mystery Corpse!
-Corpse!

00:48:18.367 --> 00:48:19.667
Yes, you become a corpse.

00:48:19.733 --> 00:48:22.500
The corpse! Corpse!
They've found the corpse!

00:48:22.567 --> 00:48:23.567
MYSTERIOUS CORPSE

00:48:25.167 --> 00:48:27.167
-They've found the corpse?
-Yes, here is a picture of him, look!

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.767
The body of a man, man called A. D.
was found on the roadside

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.633
yesterday afternoon in Ankara!

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.200
It says Ankara, brother!

00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:40.567
What is the corpse doing in Ankara?

00:48:41.567 --> 00:48:43.000
How should I know?

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.700
Gosh!

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.700
Man!

00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:53.500
They're coming to arrest us!

00:48:53.567 --> 00:48:56.600
Ok! Just relax, will you?

00:48:57.033 --> 00:48:59.800
We will deny it. We'll say
we didn't do it. Don't act suspiciously.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.700
Gosh! I acted suspicious, Yavuz.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.733
-What did you do?
-I winked, Yavuz!

00:49:09.033 --> 00:49:10.367
Why did you wink at a stranger?

00:49:10.433 --> 00:49:13.733
I didn't want to blink! I winked my left
eye but couldn't wink with the right one!

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.133
He's going to think that
I'm flirting with him!

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.067
Damn it!

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.700
-Run!
-Freeze! Police!

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.200
The game is up, Yavuz!

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:31.600
Nothing is over. Leave it to me!

00:49:32.467 --> 00:49:35.200
He did everything! I'm innocent!

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.333
He also knocked out Ismail!
He's to blame!

00:49:38.533 --> 00:49:41.233
What a snitch you are!

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:46.033
Why are you running?
You're wasting your energy in vain!

00:49:46.633 --> 00:49:49.533
Ma'am, is this the guy
who stole your purse?

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.267
Yes, officer. This guy snatched my purse!

00:49:54.133 --> 00:49:56.200
You're... Oh dear!

00:49:57.133 --> 00:50:00.000
Never mind! I assumed it was
something else entirely!

00:50:00.067 --> 00:50:03.633
Why did you steal the lady's purse?
Isn't it too shameful?

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.000
Look me in the eye and answer me.
Do I look like that kind of person?

00:50:07.333 --> 00:50:11.000
It was entirely an act of protest.
I was going to return it.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:12.167
What are you protesting?

00:50:12.333 --> 00:50:15.167
I was protesting the killing of animals
on the brink of extinction

00:50:15.533 --> 00:50:19.733
for the purpose of making purses,
shoes or fur coats.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.200
Those who kill animals for pleasure
are not human beings!

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.600
This is the case!

00:50:27.667 --> 00:50:28.700
-Ma'am?
-I'm sorry.

00:50:28.767 --> 00:50:30.633
I wasn't aware that they were endangered.

00:50:30.733 --> 00:50:33.633
It is not a shame not to know, ma'am,
It is a shame not to learn.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.300
From now on please be more aware.

00:50:35.567 --> 00:50:38.500
We're sorry for having prevented you
from doing your job.

00:50:38.567 --> 00:50:43.067
No, no. It's not important.
Have a good day.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.667
Let's go.

00:50:46.633 --> 00:50:50.200
I told you to leave it to me!
For God's sake!

00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:51.633
Don't run!

00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:05.400
-Mecnun!
-What?

00:51:08.333 --> 00:51:13.133
Excuse me! When you called out suddenly,
I answered reflexively.

00:51:13.333 --> 00:51:15.667
-I also didn't get enough sleep.
-Couldn't you sleep well?

00:51:15.733 --> 00:51:21.500
No, I couldn't. My conscience bothered me
all night. I couldn't sleep at all.

00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:24.300
What conscience is that?

00:51:28.467 --> 00:51:34.200
I am getting low grades in school.

00:51:34.333 --> 00:51:39.367
I was regretting that and couldn't sleep.

00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:42.433
Mecnun, I want to ask you something
but please answer me honestly.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.133
Honest answers?
For heaven's sake, Leyla!

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.267
When did I lie to you?

00:51:47.567 --> 00:51:49.067
Have I ever lied to you?

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.433
I have three months to live, Leyla.
Three months!

00:51:54.467 --> 00:51:56.600
What do you mean three months?
Three months!

00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.600
Is this a joke? Three months!

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.133
February, April, March.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.567
February, March, April.

00:52:02.733 --> 00:52:07.400
They used me as a bait then.
They said "Go for it," "You can do it."

00:52:07.467 --> 00:52:13.400
They forced me. I couldn't decide
what to do. I'm not lying.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.733
You introduced yourself as Arda.
And then...

00:52:17.333 --> 00:52:19.000
Wait a minute! What are we doing here?

00:52:19.067 --> 00:52:21.133
Are we going to accuse each other
in the middle of the street?

00:52:21.467 --> 00:52:24.800
You told me you had lost your memory.
Did I accuse you, then?

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.700
These are small problems.

00:52:26.767 --> 00:52:29.433
Please don't make something
out of nothing.

00:52:30.033 --> 00:52:32.233
Are you involved with other women
besides me?

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:34.300
Was that the problem?

00:52:34.467 --> 00:52:39.367
For God's sake, there are no other women
besides you. You are so jealous.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.267
I never cheated on you,
I don't like cheating at all.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.733
I am all alone, honest.
That's simply not all right.

00:52:46.167 --> 00:52:47.267
I'm sorry.

00:52:47.667 --> 00:52:53.400
Arda came to my place this morning
and told me you were a killer.

00:52:53.467 --> 00:52:55.033
Oh my God! How did he know?

00:52:55.233 --> 00:52:56.233
What?

00:52:56.767 --> 00:53:01.200
Why did he make that up, I mean?
He's just blathering. What nonsense!

00:53:01.267 --> 00:53:03.333
-It is nonsense, right?
-It is nonsense!

00:53:03.467 --> 00:53:05.733
Why are you talking to him anyway?

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.067
He is a scoundrel! He is scum!
A disgusting villain!

00:53:08.467 --> 00:53:10.200
He's not responsible for that.
He's got it in his genes.

00:53:10.267 --> 00:53:12.267
Maybe he is not responsible,
but are you still going to believe him?

00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:14.133
Are you going to believe a genetically
modified organism

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.233
or an organic man like me who sucked milk
three years in a row from his mother?

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.100
-You say there is no such thing.
-Believe me!

00:53:19.167 --> 00:53:21.567
Mecnun!

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.267
-They've found it!
-What have they found?

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:24.433
The corpse!

00:53:25.233 --> 00:53:26.633
-What?
-The corpse!

00:53:26.733 --> 00:53:28.400
Oh Lord! I'm making him repeat!

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.300
Leyla, we need to speak about
an urgent matter. Now!

00:53:31.533 --> 00:53:32.800
We've killed a man!

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.400
God damn you, Brother Erdal!

00:53:35.467 --> 00:53:37.133
God damn you, Brother Erdal!

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.100
Why are you talking about the last thing
all over again? How tactless can you be?!

00:53:40.167 --> 00:53:41.767
Can we leave here and talk, Leyla?

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.767
I am a candid man, Yavuz. That's who I am.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.233
Iskender!

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.367
Iskender!

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:59.700
How can this corpse be in Ankara?
I don't understand.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.633
Do you think one of us took the body
to Ankara?

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.433
Don't talk nonsense, Yavuz!
We're all here.

00:54:08.467 --> 00:54:11.467
Hodja sir, I think you may have a clearer
idea about this matter.

00:54:11.533 --> 00:54:13.200
Frankly, we would like to hear about it.

00:54:13.267 --> 00:54:16.333
Erdal, leave him alone.

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.700
He stole my idea.

00:54:18.367 --> 00:54:22.100
He stole the idea but
what happened anyway?

00:54:22.367 --> 00:54:25.000
The corpse is in Ankara? What happened?

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.667
Listen. I think you shouldn't worry
about the reason.

00:54:28.033 --> 00:54:31.433
Since the corpse is in Ankara,
it means you're okay.

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.733
It means he didn't die here.
It means no one will be looking for you.

00:54:39.767 --> 00:54:42.433
Yes, of course!

00:54:42.533 --> 00:54:46.400
Finally! Then the case is closed, right?

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.033
-Finally!
-Finally!

00:54:49.367 --> 00:54:51.467
I was so tense.

00:54:53.067 --> 00:54:55.667
Finally! You sold Ismail out
straight away!

00:54:56.467 --> 00:54:58.400
If we don't deliver the bag
they will kill Ismail!

00:55:01.033 --> 00:55:04.567
Yavuz, you didn't let us enjoy the moment!

00:55:04.633 --> 00:55:08.400
You can enjoy the moment!
I'm going to Ankara!

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.567
If the corpse is there, so is the bag!

00:55:10.633 --> 00:55:12.367
-How will you get there?
-I don't know! By train?

00:55:12.433 --> 00:55:14.200
You're a genius!

00:55:14.267 --> 00:55:18.533
Did you also think that they will kill
Ismail ten times over

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.100
-while you are on the road!
-Is it that far?

00:55:21.167 --> 00:55:24.567
It is 450 km. from here.
The round trip takes too much time.

00:55:25.567 --> 00:55:27.100
Too far!

00:55:27.167 --> 00:55:28.567
I can't imagine it.

00:55:29.033 --> 00:55:31.033
-Listen to me, Yavuz.
-900 km.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.733
Since the police are not after us,

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.500
maybe we should go and
inform them about Ismail.

00:55:35.667 --> 00:55:39.733
Don't talk nonsense, Erdal. They'll kill
Brother Ismail that very moment.

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.000
He's right.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.500
Stop there!

00:55:43.267 --> 00:55:46.733
There is only one way to save Ismail,
and we're going to try that!

00:55:47.733 --> 00:55:49.300
We'll sort it out!

00:55:49.367 --> 00:55:50.467
What are we going to do?

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:54.567
The guy with a moustache.

00:55:56.433 --> 00:55:58.733
What happened to 23-23?

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.600
You've done their best by notifying us.

00:56:03.467 --> 00:56:06.567
Everybody else would try to be a hero.

00:56:06.633 --> 00:56:08.733
Wouldn't they tell the officer,
wouldn't they?

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.767
If everyone did his job, there
would be no problems in the country.

00:56:14.333 --> 00:56:16.433
Well said! Excuse me. I need to leave.

00:56:16.533 --> 00:56:18.767
My colleague is taking your friend's
testimony.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.500
If something happens you can call me
anytime.

00:56:21.567 --> 00:56:25.200
Thank you very much!
Have a nice testimony.

00:56:27.067 --> 00:56:30.400
-Don't we know how to call the police?
-Well said!

00:56:31.067 --> 00:56:32.633
He stole my idea again.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.700
Didn't I suggest the same thing back
at the house? You didn't listen to me.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.033
But they said that they were going to
shoot Ismail.

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.233
Otherwise, it was my first plan, too!

00:56:44.767 --> 00:56:49.667
And then, they imprisoned me in a room.
I was so afraid to be all alone there.

00:56:49.733 --> 00:56:55.667
They also didn't give me any pajamas,
but later I fell asleep.

00:56:56.067 --> 00:57:02.667
I had nightmares about those
gross sitcoms.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.100
That's the story. We went after the bag
for Brother Ismail.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.300
I didn't see it coming.

00:57:14.367 --> 00:57:16.367
I think you should go to police and
tell them everything.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.000
In conclusion, it was an accident.

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.333
I was going to tell them, but I was scared
I would be sent to prison.

00:57:28.067 --> 00:57:30.500
I was scared to be away from you.

00:57:32.767 --> 00:57:36.700
I would always wait for you,
whether it's a minute or a lifetime.

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:41.000
A lifetime? Do you think
I would be jailed for life?

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.067
Wait a second!

00:57:43.467 --> 00:57:44.567
What?

00:57:44.767 --> 00:57:46.267
Wait a second!

00:57:46.533 --> 00:57:47.767
What happened?

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.300
Nothing happened! Have we lost contact
somewhere or what?

00:57:51.433 --> 00:57:54.467
-Why did this happen now?
-I don't know.

00:57:55.267 --> 00:57:56.467
Come.

00:57:58.667 --> 00:57:59.767
Oh, my darling.

00:58:03.233 --> 00:58:05.467
Why is this happening?
There's nothing unusual.

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.733
God! Now should be the right time!
Does it have to be now?

00:58:13.133 --> 00:58:17.600
Don't panic! Let's ask Grandpa!

00:58:17.667 --> 00:58:18.800
Yes, to Grandpa! Let's go!

00:58:23.033 --> 00:58:28.767
Pakize, Pakize! I have bought fish.
You can cook them.

00:58:30.267 --> 00:58:33.033
Don't waste your breath!
Pakize is visiting a neighbor.

00:58:34.167 --> 00:58:38.233
Ok then, you can clean and cook these.
They are so delicious.

00:58:38.533 --> 00:58:43.433
The house will stink all over!
What's the point?

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.667
Fish Grandpa, fish.
Look at my face, Grandpa

00:58:46.733 --> 00:58:50.333
there is a big smile on my face,
while this smile is still on my face

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.100
please let's do this and
let's live happily ever after.

00:58:54.167 --> 00:58:55.800
Look, I also bought figs.

00:58:56.033 --> 00:58:59.067
Fish and figs...

00:58:59.133 --> 00:59:02.067
Let's take the oven to the garden
and cook the fish outside.

00:59:02.133 --> 00:59:05.200
Delicious fish and figs!

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.367
Isn't it too mysterious?

00:59:11.433 --> 00:59:15.133
Now that the corpse has been found in
Ankara, we're not considered murderers.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:19.567
Brother Ismail is also okay. No problem.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.267
I can hold Leyla's hand.
There is no problem.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:28.433
Then everything is fine! No problem
anymore! Did we solve everything?

00:59:28.733 --> 00:59:30.433
Can we be happy?

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.600
Do we have any problems
related to happiness?

00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:35.133
Can we be happy?
Then, I am so happy now!

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.700
I am so happy now!

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.467
Happiness really confuses me!
Should I jump off from there?

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.700
Will you marry me? Leyla, marry me now!

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.033
No, no way.

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:50.033
Why are you talking like that?
If you let me, I'll go to the pier

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.333
and dive into the sea, find that ring and
make you wear it!

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.800
Even if I don't find the ring

00:59:56.033 --> 00:59:59.600
I will pick oysters and make you a
necklace from all those pearls!

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.067
If I can't find oysters I can find
mussels! Mussels!

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:07.333
Do you want stuffed mussels?

01:00:08.133 --> 01:00:11.500
Grandpa, you're a really nice man!
I really love you.

01:00:11.567 --> 01:00:13.767
-Ok, son! Ok!
-Grandpa!

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.133
-Don't push me, Grandpa. I love you!
-Ok, son! Ok!

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.500
-You're a really nice man Grandpa!
-Ok, son. Don't get excited!

01:00:23.567 --> 01:00:28.467
-Do you want a gift? Let me buy a gift!
-No, son. Thank you.

01:00:29.533 --> 01:00:35.200
Do you want a stick? A luxury stick?
This one is too old. Too old fashioned.

01:00:35.567 --> 01:00:38.267
-May be we can varnish this one.
-I don't want anything, son.

01:00:38.333 --> 01:00:40.433
-I am so happy, Grandpa!
-Ok!

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.733
Leyla aren't you happy? We're so happy,
right?

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.367
What happened to you?
What's with the long face?

01:00:47.767 --> 01:00:50.400
-My dad called.
-What happened?

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.033
He's kicking us out of the house.

01:00:54.167 --> 01:00:55.767
He also asked me to pay my debts.

01:00:57.267 --> 01:01:00.067
I asked him for a little more time.

01:01:00.133 --> 01:01:01.133
Ok, what did he say?

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.233
He said, "Screw your time!"
As if the time changes anything!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.367
We can't find that amount of money.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.567
My head!

01:01:11.533 --> 01:01:13.767
I'm sorry for what's happening.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.700
It's not important.

01:01:16.467 --> 01:01:18.667
We can't be together in any way!

01:01:18.733 --> 01:01:21.167
Don't bother. You'll find a solution.

01:01:22.667 --> 01:01:24.500
Do you think there is a solution?

01:01:24.567 --> 01:01:27.400
I don't know but we've still
saved the world.

01:01:27.733 --> 01:01:29.300
It was a piece of cake compared
to this.

01:01:45.033 --> 01:01:49.800
Ok Uncle Metin, I'm off then.
See you later. Get well soon.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
Don't worry, everything will be ok.

01:01:56.733 --> 01:01:58.233
Sevim, what is that smell?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.600
I smeared some vinegar on your head.
It's good for you.

01:02:00.667 --> 01:02:04.267
Vinegar? Take it off! It smells awful!

01:02:05.133 --> 01:02:08.000
Do you think we should apply potatoes
instead? That's good, too.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.300
-Let's ask that guy on the motorcycle.
-That guy?

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.133
-You! Lad!
-Lad?

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.533
I'm a 32 year old man!

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.633
Oh, you look younger!

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.367
I exercise!

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.733
We're looking for Grocer Erdal.
Do you know where he is?

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.200
-Grocer Erdal?
-Yes.

01:02:31.467 --> 01:02:33.067
What are you going to do with Erdal?

01:02:33.133 --> 01:02:34.667
We're going to buy flour from him.

01:02:34.733 --> 01:02:36.767
We came from Ankara just to buy
flour from him!

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.167
-Flour?
-Yes.

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:40.767
Brother, we're the police. Do you know
where this grocer is?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.567
Yes, I know.

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:45.500
Go straight from here then turn left.
You'll see it.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.700
-Straight on the left?
-Yes.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.067
You see? We're on the right track.

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:52.367
He knows, he just asked to
show off!

01:02:52.433 --> 01:02:54.300
Why do you bother, Kamil?

01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:57.367
Kamil?

01:02:57.633 --> 01:02:59.300
How does he know my name?

01:03:02.167 --> 01:03:05.233
Here it is, on the left.

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:11.100
Actually it doesn't look like
a grocery store but

01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:16.667
there's this sign that says Grocer Erdal.
It's more like a kiosk.

01:03:19.667 --> 01:03:21.300
In the end, it's an Istanbul
grocery store.

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:25.100
Hey, this is Super Mario.

01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:26.567
Who is he?

01:03:26.633 --> 01:03:30.067
You know, there is a scum bag
who sticks his nose in everywhere.

01:03:30.133 --> 01:03:32.333
-Oh, the plumber.
-Yes, the plumber.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.300
He plays tricks and is also a womanizer.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:40.133
-Are you Erdal?
-Yes I am. Who are you?

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.333
We're are from the
Istanbul Chamber of Grocers.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.367
We wanted to know
if you are short of something or not.

01:03:46.533 --> 01:03:48.200
Is there anything
you are short of, brother?

01:03:48.267 --> 01:03:51.133
No, thank you. Everything is fine.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.367
Brother, what kind of a grocer is this?
You sell chicken gyro kebab.

01:03:55.433 --> 01:03:57.500
There are oranges.
There's also a water pipe.

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:01.400
-Do you have apple flavored water pipe?
-Yes.

01:04:02.233 --> 01:04:03.733
-Do you want some?
-Yes, of course.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.633
-We want it, right?
-No, we don't.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.167
We're from the Ankara Bureau of
Homicide Investigations.

01:04:08.767 --> 01:04:11.233
Do you know Dogru, Ahmet?
Ahmet Dogru?

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.600
Brother! Do you know Ahmet Dogru?

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.233
What's he doing?

01:04:22.433 --> 01:04:24.200
I think he's flirting with you!

01:04:27.433 --> 01:04:29.167
Are you flirting with me, brother?

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:32.567
No! I didn't do anything.
I knew they'd set me up!

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.133
I wasn't by myself. We were all together.

01:04:36.433 --> 01:04:39.567
Look here! Can a person confess so easily?

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.400
You were so easy!

01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:44.567
Since you are confessing, tell us about
Iskender also.

01:04:45.033 --> 01:04:46.133
Do you know about Iskender?

01:04:47.533 --> 01:04:49.000
Where is he?

01:04:50.767 --> 01:04:52.233
Do you know where he is?

01:04:59.767 --> 01:05:01.000
Well!

01:05:05.133 --> 01:05:06.233
Have a nice day!

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.567
Thank you.

01:05:08.767 --> 01:05:11.533
Oh! You're going to eat fish for dinner,
brother?

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:13.367
Brother!

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.200
Yes we're going to eat fish.
By the way, who are you?

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.033
Let me explain who we are.
We're are from Greenpeace.

01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:20.800
We're going to measure yours.

01:05:22.033 --> 01:05:24.267
-Measure what?
-Fish, we're going to measure the fish!

01:05:24.367 --> 01:05:26.167
If they are smaller than my index finger

01:05:26.233 --> 01:05:28.433
I'm going to take you to court and then
I'll beat you!

01:05:31.567 --> 01:05:34.000
You idiot! Get out off my yard!

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.000
Get out!

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.467
Chief, do you see what he's doing?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.667
I will make you...

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.233
Did you just say Chief?

01:05:48.367 --> 01:05:50.567
Yes I did. Are you scared a little?

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:56.500
-Brother, why did you kill Ahmet?
-Ahmet?

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:14.567
There is no murder, Chief. I don't know
Ahmet.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.500
Don't lie to me! Don't make me mad!

01:06:18.567 --> 01:06:19.700
I don't want to be harsh!

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.733
The grocer told us everything!
He stayed in your house!

01:06:22.033 --> 01:06:26.400
Damned Grocer! It's a conspiracy, Chief!

01:06:26.467 --> 01:06:29.067
That Grocer is... That Grocer...

01:06:30.533 --> 01:06:34.567
They're blaming each other.
Why are you so dumb?

01:06:34.633 --> 01:06:38.200
You killed the man, but you left
the murder plan in his pocket.

01:06:38.433 --> 01:06:39.767
-Plan?
-Look here!

01:06:40.567 --> 01:06:43.667
There is a Grandpa. Is it a code name?

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:45.667
-Code name?
-Look here.

01:06:46.267 --> 01:06:47.700
-Is Grandpa a code name?
-Code name?

01:06:48.267 --> 01:06:53.333
Come on! Here is the Grandpa!
He has a beard. He is white!

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.000
Here is Grandpa!

01:06:58.633 --> 01:06:59.667
What is this?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.200
Are you ok?

01:07:06.667 --> 01:07:11.233
Actually the middle seat is kind of...
Okay, okay, I'm fine.

01:07:11.433 --> 01:07:14.500
Ok. Suit yourselves.
There is more to come!

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:18.367
Grocer!

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.167
Who drew up that plan?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.033
Yavuz.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.767
Yavuz?

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:33.367
Do you know where this Yavuz is?
Spit it out!

01:07:42.067 --> 01:07:44.067
-Brother! Are you Yavuz?
-Yes.

01:07:44.567 --> 01:07:45.767
What are you doing?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.467
Are you stealing the TV
in broad daylight?

01:07:47.767 --> 01:07:49.667
Shame on you brother! Am I such a person?

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.433
It consumes too much electricity, so I'm
taking it to an authorized service center.

01:07:53.633 --> 01:07:58.233
They say this model displays
a wider image, is it true?

01:07:58.767 --> 01:08:01.133
What they say is phony, rubbish.
What do you think?

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:05.033
It's an urban legend.
Don't believe any of it.

01:08:05.233 --> 01:08:10.767
Ok then, find me one of these models.
I am getting married soon.

01:08:11.067 --> 01:08:12.100
Really? How soon?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.800
Don't make fun of him!

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:17.033
Did you draw this?

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.300
Where did you find it?

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.733
Yes I drew it.

01:08:21.267 --> 01:08:22.600
It is kind of piece of art, right?

01:08:23.067 --> 01:08:27.033
Yes, it's a piece of art. Come with me!

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:28.100
Where are we going?

01:08:28.167 --> 01:08:30.600
Walk! Come with me!

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.633
Open the trunk. brother.
Let me put it in your trunk.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:34.700
Open the trunk!

01:08:34.767 --> 01:08:37.233
He's very eager!

01:08:37.333 --> 01:08:39.200
Do you know the two of us?

01:08:39.433 --> 01:08:41.067
-Aren't you going to open the trunk?
-I will open it!

01:08:44.067 --> 01:08:47.767
Easy, easy! Don't scratch it!

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.433
I'm holding it. Let it go!

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.033
Get inside!

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:01.233
-But it's full!
-Get inside! You incompetent twit!

01:09:01.533 --> 01:09:03.500
-Get inside, lengthwise!
-Squeeze!

01:09:04.033 --> 01:09:06.633
That's it! Well done!

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.100
Get out your feet out of the window.
That's it! Well done!

01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:14.200
We can't take any more!

01:09:14.267 --> 01:09:17.367
As long as we find them,
we can find a spot for them.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.333
Let's go! The road is clear!

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:24.633
Come a little bit, come, come!

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.200
Whom are you waving your hand at?

01:09:49.633 --> 01:09:52.567
I am waving at no one.
Anyone can take it personally.

01:09:54.667 --> 01:09:57.467
Ok. This is certainly that guy.

01:09:58.233 --> 01:10:00.633
-What's your name? Is it Ismail?
-Yes, what do you need that for?

01:10:01.033 --> 01:10:03.267
We are out of Ismail stock in Ankara,

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.767
so we're looking for shiny new
Ismails here.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.333
-Do you want to come with us to Ankara?
-Really!

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.400
Yes!

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:13.433
But I can't come with you.
I am waiting here for the ship.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.433
-What ship?
-Freighter.

01:10:19.567 --> 01:10:20.767
Should we leave him?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.233
I think so! Look at him!
Besides, we would need a big spot for him.

01:10:25.267 --> 01:10:29.100
No, we can't leave him.
You can sit together. Let's take him.

01:10:29.167 --> 01:10:31.733
Sit together? I'm driving, Chief!

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.033
What do you mean you are driving?

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.700
You drove to here. I will drive
on the way back.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.033
You will sit with this guy
in the front seat

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.133
and you will take a rest.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.300
Picture me with this guy
in the front seat.

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:43.667
You're skinny. You should sit together.

01:10:43.733 --> 01:10:46.000
Son! You're talking as if you're a woman!

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.367
Really! I don't want to interrupt
but you're talking too much!

01:10:52.433 --> 01:10:55.600
Why do you care! I'll throw you
on the ground! Now you'll see!

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:58.167
-Stop!
-Get off me! You are huge!

01:10:58.733 --> 01:11:00.167
-How can I resist you!
-What's that?

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.400
Huge!

01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:07.800
What was the other guy's name?

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:12.467
Mecnun!

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.533
Do you know Mecnun?

01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:18.467
Mecnun! Yes, I know him. He's my brother.

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:23.367
He is not my full brother,
but I love him so much!

01:11:23.433 --> 01:11:26.167
Fine. Do you know where we can find him?

01:11:26.667 --> 01:11:28.167
There he is!

01:11:31.033 --> 01:11:32.233
Mecnun!

01:11:35.033 --> 01:11:36.033
What's up?

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.100
What do you mean what's up?

01:11:37.533 --> 01:11:38.800
I mean what are you doing now?

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.300
Nothing! I'm standing. I feel blue!

01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:43.067
-Why is that?
-What?

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.400
Why is that?

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.467
Leyla!

01:11:46.433 --> 01:11:47.767
Did she leave you again?

01:11:48.267 --> 01:11:50.600
Brother why are you shouting?
Call him over here!

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:53.633
Mecnun, come here.
These guys are calling you.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.200
What?

01:11:55.267 --> 01:11:57.333
Come here!

01:11:57.633 --> 01:12:01.300
Don't order me around!
Don't make hand gestures!

01:12:01.367 --> 01:12:04.133
-Lower your hand or else I'll beat you!
-Easy, easy!

01:12:04.367 --> 01:12:08.000
Mecnun! He's not ordering around!

01:12:08.333 --> 01:12:09.333
What do you mean he's not
ordering around?

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.567
He is not ordering around!

01:12:10.633 --> 01:12:14.333
Come here, son! We're the police!

01:12:15.367 --> 01:12:16.467
The police?

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:20.467
Please excuse me! There is a big
misunderstanding. How can we solve this?

01:12:20.533 --> 01:12:23.233
Why do you still call me brother?

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.500
Why didn't you listen to me
while you were there?

01:12:25.567 --> 01:12:26.633
For God's sake!

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:32.500
I assumed you were friends with
Brother Ismail.

01:12:33.167 --> 01:12:34.333
Friends? With that guy?

01:12:34.667 --> 01:12:36.600
Did you really assume that
we were friends?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.767
-Damn me! I'm so sorry!
-Damn you!

01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:44.700
-Give me the keys!
-No. I will drive the car.

01:12:45.433 --> 01:12:47.067
Give me those keys!

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.033
Give them to me!

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:53.133
You'll sit first. I'll sit on the
window side.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.500
-Where am I going to sit?
-There!

01:12:56.367 --> 01:12:57.700
How are we supposed to squeeze in there?

01:12:57.767 --> 01:13:04.600
Get in! Be careful! Squeeze!
Be careful!

01:13:09.233 --> 01:13:10.267
Are you okay?

01:13:10.567 --> 01:13:12.700
Yes! It's more comfortable
than business class!

01:13:13.233 --> 01:13:16.433
-You?
-The handbrake is kinda...

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:21.333
What are you up to?

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:27.267
I think you should go. I can't travel
long distances. It makes me sick!

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:31.600
Grandpa! Mecnun!
Call me when you get there!

01:13:32.433 --> 01:13:34.267
It's 450 km. It's a very long distance.

01:13:35.233 --> 01:13:36.467
Come in!

01:13:36.533 --> 01:13:39.033
There is a TV inside.
What a nice surprise!

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.467
Don't break it!

01:13:47.067 --> 01:13:48.767
Is everybody here?

01:13:49.633 --> 01:13:53.300
Four in the back.
The fifth is in the trunk.
