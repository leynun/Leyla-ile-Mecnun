LEYLA AND MECNUN

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:55.000
EPISODE 13

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:59.333
What a beautiful city!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.033
How about you finish school and
work as a civil servant here!

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:12.200
Who? Me, a civil servant! No way dad.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.067
A civil servant! Do I look like
a civil servant to you!

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.800
I don't even know how to tie a necktie.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.267
Civil servants are very nervous
and stressed-out people.

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:28.433
What is this! What kind of food is this!

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.533
If what we eat in
Istanbul is called bagel,

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.200
this should have another name.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:33.667
Right, Iskender!

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:35.167
I'm not talking to you.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:38.000
-Why!
-What kind of a man are you!

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500
Why did you tell our names to the police!

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:45.000
I told you already, they had the paper.
I am not the one who drew it, he is.

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:47.767
Don't downgrade it by calling it paper,
it's a work of art.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.067
I drew it so well that they found us
right away. Besides,

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:54.667
how do we know you didn't snitch
on us during the interrogation!

00:02:55.467 --> 00:03:01.567
<i>I don't want to point the finger at anyone</i>
<i>but there is Yavuz,</i>

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.100
<i>the thief.</i>

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.133
<i>A thief, a bandit. He's not reliable.</i>

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:14.467
<i>Check him out. Today a thief,</i>
<i>tomorrow a murderer.</i>

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.133
<i>-Check him out.</i>
<i>-Tell the truth!</i>

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.433
Shame on you Yavuz,
Am I that kind of a person!

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:24.367
I'm getting even more suspicious.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:27.433
You are exaggerating Yavuz,
Erdal wouldn't do such a thing.

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:30.100
We are friends.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:31.467
Does a person sell out a friend!

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.367
Am I wrong, Iskender!

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.067
<i>Have you committed a planned murder!</i>

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:43.000
<i>Erdal. Grocer. I mean Erdal.</i>
<i>He must have done it.</i>

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:45.733
<i>He must have pushed him to do it.</i>

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.600
<i>They never got along with</i>
<i>the deceased anyway.</i>

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.367
<i>They always had a problem.</i>

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.800
<i>He shot Erdal in the hand before he died.</i>

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.767
<i>Yes, plastic bullets, but they still hurt.</i>

00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:04.433
<i>Watch that guy!</i>

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.000
You're right, pal, he wouldn't do it.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.067
We are friends. Yavuz! It is all over,
what's the point of still bothering him!

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:14.167
Did you do anything behind our backs?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.767
Come on, brother. I didn't even
open my mouth, I swear.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:33.500
Enough already. Here we are blaming
each other in beautiful Ankara.

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:36.167
This is not us.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.800
<i>Your name is Mecnun, right!</i>

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.767
<i>I can't believe you! We were packed</i>
<i>practically on top of each other</i>

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:48.400
<i>traveling 450 kilometers to come here</i>
<i>Where to begin?</i>

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:53.400
<i>My grandpa wasn't fond of the deceased.</i>

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.633
<i>He's not my real grandpa, I saw him in</i>
<i>my dream and when I woke up, there he was.</i>

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:00.700
<i>He stays at our house. Can you believe it!</i>

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.533
<i>He sleeps in my bed.</i>

00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:08.433
<i>He has a stick. Would a normal man</i>
<i>walk around with a stick!</i>

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:11.267
-Don't you think so, buddy!
-Buddy!

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.400
Grandpa, I said grandpa.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.700
What happened to our conversation!
What do you say?

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.200
We are not people who would sell
each other out, are we!

00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:41.333
<i>I told them to stop! I told them</i>
<i>not to do it!</i>

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:43.033
<i>But they didn't listen to me.</i>

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:45.233
<i>Then, they all started to fight.</i>

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.100
<i>While they were pulling the bag,</i>
<i>the man fell down.</i>

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:51.533
<i>That's how it happened.</i>

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.733
Grandpa! Did you spill the beans?

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:59.800
Shame on you. Even I wouldn't do this.

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:06.400
We tried so hard not to talk
and you threw us to the wolves.

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:12.367
I took all the risk and just shut up in
there. I didn't even open my mouth.

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:15.733
Stop! At least, I told the truth.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.467
What if one of you told
something different!

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:23.167
Who could have done that, grandpa!

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:27.333
<i>Do you realize that what you are saying is</i>
<i>not the same as what you hear!</i>

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.200
<i>-Chief.</i>
<i>-What is he talking about!</i>

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:31.533
<i>I really don't understand this man</i>

00:06:31.767 --> 00:06:35.100
<i>I did it. It's not anyone else's fault.</i>

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:37.533
<i>He took my bag, and I pushed him down.</i>

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.167
<i>You pushed him, my foot!</i>
<i>You weren't even there, babyface.</i>

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:45.600
<i>How do you know that?</i>
<i>Do you have a witness! Who saw it?</i>

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:49.067
<i>I'm saying I did it. Set them free.</i>
<i>Take me to jail.</i>

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.033
Never mind. I don't care who said what.

00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:57.600
We are out, we have bagels, we have tea.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.567
We are in Ankara. Let's enjoy it.
Look, that's Odakule tower.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.767
-Odakule, right.
-Yes, Odakule.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.600
That's a tower! That's a tower!
That's a tower, too! I know that as well.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.367
That's not what I'm saying.
I know that's Atakule.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:14.700
Look, that's a castle.

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:18.700
Yes but they demolished SSK Passage,
what about that, Brother Ismail!

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:24.000
You broke my heart now, Brother Ismail.

00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:28.167
I can't even eat my bagel, I'm so sad.

00:07:28.367 --> 00:07:30.100
You reminded me of Leyla.

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:33.300
I wonder what they are doing now.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.167
They didn't have any money. Do you think
they could have moved to a new house?

00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:40.167
Let me call her.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.133
My phone is dead, see! Can I use
your phone dad?

00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:47.167
My phone is dead, too, son.

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:51.767
-But you charged it all night!
-Didn't they send you to jail?

00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:58.433
Where did you come from! Damn it!
This is Ankara. How did you find us!

00:07:58.533 --> 00:08:00.700
Arda, son, what are you doing here really!

00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:05.067
I saw them take you away, Grandpa.
I came all the way here to help.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.133
<i>Mecnun would have done</i>
<i>the same thing, too.</i>

00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:10.300
<i>How did we not think of him!</i>

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.667
<i>I mean I don't know what he did but if</i>
<i>there is some dirty business,</i>

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:15.300
<i>it's him for sure.</i>
<i>You know why?</i>

00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:20.100
<i>Because he's an asshole.</i>
<i>He's a real scumbag. It's him for sure.</i>

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:24.267
<i>I think you should catch him right away.</i>
<i>Lock him up in a high security prison.</i>

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:27.667
<i>He should be thrown in some corner</i>
<i>and left to rot there.</i>

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.800
<i>-What's he talking about?</i>
<i>-Get out of here! You nutcase!</i>

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:33.800
<i>-Should I leave then?</i>
<i>-Go away.</i>

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:39.400
How are you going to help! I came to
Ankara. What kind of a man are you!

00:08:39.633 --> 00:08:44.067
I'm in Ankara. Leyla is in Istanbul.
I'm in Ankara. Are you in love with me?

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:46.733
Enough already about Leyla!

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.567
Mecnun, look at what has happened to us
because of Leyla.

00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:52.467
Because of Leyla! Is this
because of Leyla!

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.733
For God's sake dad!

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:57.533
We are eating a nice bagel and having tea.
We are in Ankara.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.333
The bagel is nice, you are right.
It's really good, Ismail.

00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:02.767
But almost went to jail.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.467
Was it because of Leyla?
Why do you say that?

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:07.600
To some extent, yes, Mecnun.

00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:11.600
If you hadn't brought that man
to our place

00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:14.100
he wouldn't have met Ismail.
If he hadn't met Ismail

00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:16.767
he wouldn't have stolen his bag.
If he hadn't stolen Ismail's bag

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.767
we wouldn't have chased him to the
construction site

00:09:19.033 --> 00:09:22.633
Erdal, enough already, stop it,
I've had enough.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.633
I was just about to finish, Iskender.
I was at the construction site.

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:32.633
Hey, Ankara, babe! I'm telling you, let go
of Leyla, dude. Find another girl.

00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:34.767
-Look, get out of here!
-Don't talk like that!

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.567
Enough already! Stop it. Behave
yourselves. Arda, is your car available!

00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:41.433
Yes, it is. There's a suitcase in the back
seat but it's available.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.067
-You came with a suitcase!
-Yes, I wanted to be ready.

00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:48.500
Ok, go. Let's go. Everyone in the car!

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:52.100
-What! I would never get in his car, dad.
-Ok then, you can return by train.

00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:55.567
-What train! Dad, please.
-Mecnun, I'm off.

00:09:55.633 --> 00:09:57.033
What do you mean you're off
Brother Ismail!

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.233
What are you doing! Don't go!
Where are you going! What is this!

00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:06.000
God damn all of you!

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:10.367
Dad, I have no money! Grandpa! You, too!

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:13.100
-Open the trunk Arda.
-I don't have any money!

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.433
Arda! You all got into the car
like bloody idiots.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.433
At least give me some bagel.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.433
Give me some change.

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:26.533
-We'll see you at the sea shore.
-I have no money, chum.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.067
See you at the coast.

00:10:39.067 --> 00:10:41.333
Painting the exterior of the building
is a must.

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.333
The windows and roof require repair, too.

00:10:44.733 --> 00:10:46.700
The door is old, too. We should have
a steel door.

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:51.300
-We can't get the stuff from home, can we!
-No. It's all been impounded.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.600
Never mind. The sofas I bought when I was
moving are still at the girls' house.

00:10:56.733 --> 00:11:00.433
We'll bring them here. After that,
it will be a very nice, cozy home.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.267
Sevim! Leyla! Are you out of your minds!

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:05.467
No, personally I'm not. Mom?

00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:06.633
No, I'm rather sane too. I'm OK.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.400
I can manage for another
three to five years.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.333
Look at them. Mother and daughter have
joined forces to laugh at me.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:12.633
Is this a place fit to live in!

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.700
Look at it. It's a wreck.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.533
Daddy, be a little more positive,
will you!

00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:21.267
Yes, we were kicked out of our home.

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:24.467
No one is giving you a job
because of Arda's dad.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.167
We couldn't find a house to suit
our budget, and all that.

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:31.067
Anything else? Is there anything
I missed, mom?

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.567
-The car, you forgot to mention the car.
-Correct, we don't have a car any more.

00:11:36.233 --> 00:11:37.667
I will solve the problem permanently.

00:11:38.733 --> 00:11:42.000
Here, I'll just leave it here.

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:45.033
What is this! Is this a bribe!

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:50.633
Let's not call it a bribe. It's a small
gift from us.

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:53.133
50 Liras! You have some cheek.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.767
I don't want money from you,
I want your daughter, Metin.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.767
My daughter is your daughter, sir.
Leyla is your daughter in law.

00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:04.400
Arda! What about you and Leyla!

00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:07.367
Are you serious about her or is it
just a whim?

00:12:07.433 --> 00:12:09.100
I have serious intentions, Uncle Iskender.

00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:13.600
Come on. Tell me the truth,
I know you are trying to seduce her.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.633
What are you talking about Uncle Iskender!

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:21.533
We were getting engaged but your son
came on a horse and ruined everything.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.233
Yes. My son does have such a habit.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.800
He used to spoil his friends' games
when he was little.

00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:32.400
-Hey Yavuz, look! It's just for you.
-Why are you like this!

00:12:33.433 --> 00:12:36.367
Yavuz! What are you looking at!
I told you to look at the radio.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.633
I miss Zeynep.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.633
It's the first time we have been apart
this long.

00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:45.667
You should get married pal. It's time.

00:12:45.767 --> 00:12:48.267
I hope so. God willing...

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:53.600
Do you know what's the best thing
about Ankara?

00:12:55.467 --> 00:12:58.600
-Get out of the car!
-Get out of the car!

00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:05.300
-What is this! Such an idiot.
-Get off! Shut the door!

00:13:05.467 --> 00:13:12.000
Drive, Arda. This joke never ends.

00:13:13.767 --> 00:13:17.567
Hey Nurten! Do you think they are
secretly up to something?

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:20.167
No way, sister, what can they be up to!

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:24.467
Then why did they suddenly
disappear like that?

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:28.700
You know I have spoken to Erdal.
They are all together.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.167
You won't believe what happened, Nurten!

00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:34.033
We were going to Rami to buy supplies

00:13:35.567 --> 00:13:40.567
but then we were talking and we got
confused

00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:47.400
we took the wrong turn and found ourselves
in Ankara.

00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:54.600
At that moment we got a flat tire.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:58.067
A mechanic came and you'll never guess
what he told us.

00:13:58.233 --> 00:14:00.133
He said we had a flat tire.

00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:06.600
And so, I told him to fix
it if it was flat.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.133
-Can one tell an outright lie like that?
-Ok, Nurten.

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:13.633
Do you think it's convincing at all?

00:14:14.167 --> 00:14:17.167
To tell the truth, it doesn't sound
very convincing to me, Nurten.

00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:20.567
I am personally satisfied
with this explanation.

00:14:36.367 --> 00:14:39.200
Alright, grandpa. I bought the tickets.
I had just enough money.

00:14:39.267 --> 00:14:41.700
-Did you get sleeper tickets?
-No, that was expensive,

00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:43.133
I got sitting space tickets.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.233
But I can't sleep on a seat.
I have to lie down comfortably to sleep.

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:52.567
Grandpa, the seats are also comfortable.
You can sleep there, it's not prohibited.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.267
By the way, I got us student tickets,

00:14:56.367 --> 00:14:59.600
if they ask you for your card,
pretend you're asleep, alright?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:05.067
Actually you are very old, you already
have a discount, right?

00:15:05.133 --> 00:15:07.067
Here comes the stick!

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:09.800
Ok, grandpa, ok, don't do this in public.

00:15:11.533 --> 00:15:13.800
I hardly have enough money for a ticket,

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:15.767
where would I find that much more
money for Leyla!

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.300
-How much do you need?
-A lot, for sure.

00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:23.167
If it was a lot according to us,
maybe we could have found it but

00:15:23.233 --> 00:15:27.300
it is a lot according to their standards,
what am I going to do!

00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:30.067
Don't get upset. We'll find a way.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.300
You can manage for sure.
Just act wisely.

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:40.167
-Anyway, I'll go and buy some magazines.
-Why, are you going to read them?

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:44.667
No but it's one of those things you do,
you buy stuff to read on a trip.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.467
If we don't read them we can dump them
in Istanbul.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:56.000
Hey, young man! Want to sell
your soul to me?

00:15:56.233 --> 00:16:02.467
Kamil! What are you doing here in Ankara!
Everyone is in Ankara!

00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:05.733
What are you wearing! Is that a costume?
Are you here for a children's play?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.533
Yes, I came for the children's theater.
Look, I'm a fairy tale character.

00:16:09.233 --> 00:16:14.500
Don't be ridiculous, Mecnun!
I'm a businessman. I do business.

00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:16.000
-Are you going to sell your soul to me?
-Uh?

00:16:17.067 --> 00:16:19.167
Your soul! Are you going to sell it to me?

00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:23.667
My soul! How could I sell my soul,
suddenly like his?

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:26.767
You can. It's very easy, just sign here
and we'll be done.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Are you going to take my soul
in return for a signature?

00:16:29.067 --> 00:16:30.600
What kind of a man are you!

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:33.000
What are you going to do with my soul?

00:16:33.133 --> 00:16:37.000
I thought I can use your soul if something
happens to mine.

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:39.167
Do you even need it?

00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:41.033
Have you ever needed it?

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.267
Have I ever needed it?
I fell in love thanks to that soul.

00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:50.300
Ok, you fell in love and you don't need it
anymore. Give it to me.

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:55.600
Get out of here,
I have a splitting headache.

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:58.367
What did you drink? Go away!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.467
Ok then, at least sell your
grandpa's stick to me Mecnun.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.667
Are you out of your mind?
What will you do with that stick!

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.233
I have to buy something here.
I have a bag full of money.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.100
I have to spend it. Look!

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.700
A bag full of money?

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.700
Where did you that much money?

00:17:23.267 --> 00:17:26.300
<i>Take this money and persuade Mecnun to</i>
<i>sell the stick.</i>

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.733
<i>Ok boss. You will get the stick.</i>

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:35.067
I got it from somewhere. Never mind.
It's just a wooden stick. Sell it already.

00:17:35.167 --> 00:17:37.367
So you want to buy the stick
with all this money!

00:17:37.433 --> 00:17:40.767
Yes. I will give you a bag full of money
in return for that stick, Mecnun.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.200
Hold his head!

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.633
My God.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.267
What's going on?

00:18:49.733 --> 00:18:51.233
What the hell is going on?

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.233
11 May 2023

00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:19.633
What is this uncle! What's going on!

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.400
What is this, 2023?

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:40.467
Oh my God. What's going on!

00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:47.700
Kaan Grocery

00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:51.000
Is that Kaan Grocery?

00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:57.300
What's up! Your wife's orders are ready.

00:19:57.367 --> 00:19:59.433
What wife? Who the hell are you?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.033
What on earth! Are you ok? I'm Kaan.

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:06.767
Kaan! How?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.167
Has Grandpa hit me on the head again
with his stick?

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:14.067
Your mustache is gone and it's better.
You look younger.

00:20:14.233 --> 00:20:16.367
Get out of here. Don't touch me.

00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:17.500
Where is Erdal?

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:20.167
They have moved from here, you know.
He's into another line of work now.

00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:21.567
-Another line of work?
-Yes.

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:41.133
He never had the mind of a businessman,

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.400
he never understood this business,
you know.

00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:45.367
And you have! The only thing you've
achieved has been to take over this shop.

00:20:45.433 --> 00:20:47.233
Is this that what you call
a businessman's mind?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.500
That's only the beginning.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.533
I have many plans.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.733
Plans?

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.500
It's 2023 and you're still talking about
plans.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.700
Look at me! What have I become?

00:21:13.133 --> 00:21:14.267
How did I end up like this?

00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:16.267
Look at him!

00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:18.067
What is that lunchbox in my hand?

00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:21.600
It's 2023, what am I doing
with a lunchbox in 2023?

00:21:21.733 --> 00:21:28.367
Look, Pakize. You do it like this.

00:21:30.033 --> 00:21:32.233
-Push it like this.
-Oh, daddy.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.267
It's done.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.500
Here comes the shithead. Look at me!
What have I become?

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:45.433
What have I become?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.067
Leyla!

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.300
She's grown so fat! Is it her?
This isn't Leyla.

00:21:52.433 --> 00:21:54.300
Is that Leyla?

00:21:55.267 --> 00:22:00.633
But this isn't Leyla. Who did I marry?
Look at me!

00:22:01.467 --> 00:22:06.300
I'm talking nonsense in 2023.
God, I think I'm going mad.

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:12.500
Good. At least the seashore is
still where it used to be.

00:22:16.067 --> 00:22:18.500
Didn't I get any sleep?
What happened to me?

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.300
Mecnun!

00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:28.100
What's up!

00:22:28.233 --> 00:22:30.200
-Brother Ismail. How are you?
-I'm fine.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:36.300
I'm still waiting. Everyone has a job,
except for Ismail.

00:22:37.467 --> 00:22:40.367
You were going to get me a position at
your office, and what happened?

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.767
What!

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.667
You were going to get me a position at
your place, what happened?

00:22:45.033 --> 00:22:46.633
My office!

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.533
Are you going to start working with us?

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:56.033
Ok, Mecnun, you are right. Never mind me,
live your own life. I'll manage somehow.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.100
I don't understand why things have
turned out this way. It's complicated.

00:23:00.167 --> 00:23:01.167
What!

00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:04.000
It's complicated. You know
my state of mind!

00:23:04.333 --> 00:23:05.667
-Yes!
-I don't get it.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.633
-Don't get what!
-I don't get it.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.033
I'm confused.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.167
Where is Grandpa!

00:23:13.233 --> 00:23:16.200
-He should be in the parking lot now.
-Parking lot?

00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:21.067
-Brother Ismail?
-Yes?

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.300
-Is he here!
-Yes, he is.

00:23:24.467 --> 00:23:25.800
What is he doing here?

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.767
Grandpa!

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.800
-Son!
-Grandpa! Have you shaved your beard?

00:23:36.067 --> 00:23:38.467
Yes, it was itching.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.800
You have shaved your mustache as well.

00:23:40.033 --> 00:23:43.800
You know what Grandpa? We were on
the train you and I, and you fell asleep.

00:23:44.033 --> 00:23:45.200
That's where it all happened.

00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:48.700
Before I got on the train, Kamil came to
me and

00:23:49.067 --> 00:23:55.367
offered me money to sell my soul.
He had a bag full of money.

00:23:55.467 --> 00:24:00.500
And then he asked me to sell your stick.
So, I sold him your stick.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.600
How come?
So did you come here from the past?

00:24:05.233 --> 00:24:10.300
-Yes.
-I knew it. I knew this day would come.

00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:13.400
I have always lived with this dream.
Even in my desperate moments

00:24:13.467 --> 00:24:16.800
I dreamt of this moment and now it has
come.

00:24:17.133 --> 00:24:18.400
What moment?

00:24:18.733 --> 00:24:20.767
The moment that I smash your face in!

00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:22.733
For God's sake!
What's the matter with you?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.567
How could you give my stick
to a stranger!

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:31.133
Grandpa, please. Don't do this.
You told me not to be desperate.

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:38.000
Didn't you told me to use my chances
wisely? Now he attacks me with the stick.

00:24:38.733 --> 00:24:41.400
Am I the one to blame!

00:24:41.467 --> 00:24:46.700
Look how you found a nice bat instead of
your stick, how elegant, how beautiful.

00:24:47.133 --> 00:24:51.467
You don't have to get angry.
You've become so angry with time!

00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:54.400
We have to find Leyla right away,
Grandpa. Please, let's find Leyla.

00:24:54.467 --> 00:24:56.100
I have to see Leyla.

00:24:57.133 --> 00:24:59.700
But we don't know where Leyla is, son.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:06.600
They disappeared suddenly and you
married that relative of Grocer Erdal's.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.633
It all happened
because you sold the stick.

00:25:10.167 --> 00:25:13.400
-Stop behaving so selfishly for once, son.
-Grandpa!

00:25:13.467 --> 00:25:14.800
-Life is...
-Grandpa!

00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:17.000
You have neither a beard nor a stick.

00:25:17.067 --> 00:25:19.767
Your hair is a mess, but you are
still trying to teach me a lesson.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:26.767
I admire your determination but
please stop. It's 2023.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.133
What am I supposed to do here?

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.467
I am stuck here. I can't even
return to the past.

00:25:33.633 --> 00:25:35.600
If I could returned to the past, I would
win the lottery

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.367
but I'm in the future! I don't know
what this is!

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:41.800
Did I really marry Erdal's relative
in Germany?

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.267
Don't worry son. We're here to help.
Everything has a solution.

00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:52.467
I'll take you back to where you belong.
Don't worry.

00:25:52.533 --> 00:25:53.600
How are we going to do that?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.567
With this.

00:25:55.633 --> 00:25:58.633
It's a time machine. It only has a few
minor flaws.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.400
We can get out of here as soon as
I fix them.

00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:05.100
Grandpa, what do you know
about time machines?

00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:07.300
I am trying to clean your mess here.

00:26:07.367 --> 00:26:10.300
See what he's doing instead of
thanking me?

00:26:11.333 --> 00:26:13.733
No Grandpa, this is not the way.
We have to find your stick.

00:26:14.067 --> 00:26:16.800
I will bring your stick back. I swear.

00:26:17.167 --> 00:26:18.367
We have to find Kamil first.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.633
I know where Kamil is.

00:26:24.233 --> 00:26:27.300
Let's go smash his face and take the
stick.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.100
There are very tough matches in the
league but I believe

00:26:30.167 --> 00:26:32.233
Fenerbahce will win the cup this year.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.067
They have been yearning
for it for 40 years.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.233
Kamil! Get ready.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.633
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing here?

00:26:58.733 --> 00:27:02.767
Kamil! You bullied our brother.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.600
What d'ya mean bullying, Ismail?
What are you talking about?

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.233
You took his stick.

00:27:09.433 --> 00:27:11.567
Why don't you give the stick
back to him?

00:27:12.367 --> 00:27:16.367
What stick? I don't have anybody's stick.
Don't be ridiculous.

00:27:16.433 --> 00:27:18.467
I have to go on air. Leave me alone!

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.500
What do you mean you don't have the stick?
Remember, 12 years ago

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.367
in Ankara train station.
You told me to sell you my soul. Remember.

00:27:25.433 --> 00:27:26.767
You had horns on your head.

00:27:27.033 --> 00:27:29.067
You took Grandpa's stick. Where is it

00:27:29.267 --> 00:27:30.700
I gave it to Arda's dad.

00:27:31.133 --> 00:27:34.733
Arda's dad? Why did you give it away?

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.167
Why did you give it to that man?

00:27:37.233 --> 00:27:39.533
Why did you give it to Arda's dad?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.733
He never liked us. How will we
get it back?

00:27:42.533 --> 00:27:46.067
<i>He is keeping the stick on the top floor</i>
<i>of his building.</i>

00:27:46.167 --> 00:27:48.300
<i>They are hiding it in a very secure room.</i>

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:51.167
<i>It's impossible to get in.</i>

00:27:51.267 --> 00:27:55.000
<i>No one can go through that door.</i>

00:27:56.467 --> 00:27:58.000
I know someone who can.

00:27:59.433 --> 00:28:00.433
Who?

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:04.167
You remember our Grandpa.

00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:06.800
Oh Please! Did he die?

00:28:07.733 --> 00:28:12.400
No, no. He's fine. He's alright.
He's in good health.

00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:16.367
I thought something bad happened when
you talked like that, Mecnun.

00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:20.533
He's alright, but...
I forgot what I was going to say.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.633
Actually, we have a big problem.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.067
I don't know how to begin.

00:28:28.433 --> 00:28:31.600
I'm not going to tell the whole story now.
I don't want to bother you...

00:28:31.667 --> 00:28:36.133
Mecnun gave away Grandpa's stick, Yavuz.
Correct!

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:43.333
He wants to say it but he can't spill the
beans, he's embarrassed.

00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:46.267
He can't say it. Correct! Yes.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.300
They found out he was naive so they took
the stick away from him.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.500
Brother Ismail, what do you think
are you doing?

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.167
You keep interfering all the time.

00:28:59.233 --> 00:29:02.633
-So, do we have to fight?
-Of course not!

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.800
They are keeping the stick
in a very secure room.

00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:10.533
They told us it's an impregnable room
and impossible to gain access to it.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:16.067
So I came to you. You are the only
one who can do this.

00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:17.267
You've come to the right place.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.100
There's no such word as impossible in our
dictionary.

00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:23.033
-Do you have a dictionary?
-Did I speak too boldly?

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.767
No, I think it is great.

00:29:25.033 --> 00:29:26.233
But the bottom line is that we don't, we
don't have a dictionary.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.567
We can buy one, Zeynep. Don't worry.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:29.667
Besides, I think we should write it
on the wall there.

00:29:29.733 --> 00:29:31.333
-Can we write it on the back, too?
-You're right.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.267
You can buy it easily. They have some
in stores.

00:29:34.333 --> 00:29:38.567
Sure, write it on the wall but what about
our problem? Will you help us?

00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:40.800
Did I ever refuse you anything, brother?

00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:42.333
Are there any doors I can't open?

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.767
-We'll go and get that stick.
-Well done!

00:29:45.067 --> 00:29:49.367
Well done! I mean really well done!
That's great, just like in the old days.

00:29:49.433 --> 00:29:53.733
We are putting the gang together like in
the movies. Well done!

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.167
Really! Let's go.

00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:57.767
Ismail, maybe you shouldn't come.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.700
-Why!
-It's dangerous and complicated.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.567
It's not an easy job after all.

00:30:03.733 --> 00:30:05.100
You see!

00:30:05.433 --> 00:30:07.433
It's been so many years, but he still
doesn't hear himself talking.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Do you see this?

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.700
Do you hear that?

00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:21.067
It has been so many years but he
still doesn't hear himself talking.

00:30:21.167 --> 00:30:22.533
Hear this? Nope.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.100
See this?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.200
Are they matches?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.667
No, they are candies.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.367
Of course they're matches.

00:30:34.233 --> 00:30:38.400
Your brother Ismail is a man of action.

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:41.200
Your brother Ismail is...

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.033
<i>Mission impossible.</i>

00:31:09.433 --> 00:31:11.233
How do I open this!

00:31:12.733 --> 00:31:14.200
One minute.

00:31:15.433 --> 00:31:18.067
Where is the lock?

00:31:21.367 --> 00:31:23.767
Oh hi! How much for this?

00:31:24.233 --> 00:31:30.700
Do you give a discount if we buy
it all in bulk?

00:31:31.067 --> 00:31:34.033
My friends and I are interested in this.
We are serious.

00:31:34.633 --> 00:31:36.400
Any discount for it?

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.533
No!

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.133
Fine then, please excuse me. Take care.

00:31:43.033 --> 00:31:46.067
Wait. Please turn right.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.767
I said right, is that your right?

00:31:53.167 --> 00:31:59.667
He doesn't know his right from his left.
Let me go!

00:32:03.267 --> 00:32:04.467
Do you think I should have
a pink one again?

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:06.367
-Tell me a number.
-Three.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.467
-You too!
-12.

00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:10.400
-You too!
-Seven.

00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:12.767
Let's see.

00:32:14.633 --> 00:32:17.433
-What kind of a password is this?
-Come on.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.667
Can any door resist me?

00:32:22.633 --> 00:32:23.633
What will we do now!

00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:25.800
Where did they hide the stick?

00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:30.167
-What did Kamil say?
-The secure room on the top floor.

00:32:30.367 --> 00:32:32.033
-Where is the secure room?
-On the top floor.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.733
On the top floor. Ok, let's go.

00:32:47.767 --> 00:32:53.000
Oh my God! This is not a normal lock.
We'll need a retinal scan.

00:32:53.533 --> 00:32:55.133
How will we do a retinal scan?

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.800
Relax. No problem. I'm just sorry that
I carried this bag for nothing. Zeynep!

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.767
-Eyes wide shut.
-Who!

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.700
Thank you.

00:33:09.767 --> 00:33:12.033
We got this done in an eye surgery.
Picklock retina!

00:33:12.267 --> 00:33:14.667
It comes handy in such situations.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.600
-Let's take the stick.
-Yavuz, there is a laser system.

00:33:17.667 --> 00:33:22.700
What! A laser system! This is too much.

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:25.300
It's only a stick!

00:33:25.367 --> 00:33:27.233
If they left two pairs of shoes
at the door,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.100
we would have thought there
was someone inside and wouldn't enter.

00:33:29.167 --> 00:33:31.167
Chill out, Mecnun, leave it to us.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.300
Ismail, open it.

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:47.300
-Are we ready?
-We are.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.767
Ismail! What are you doing!

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.133
You were dancing so elegantly that
I wanted to dance as well.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.233
It seemed so nice.

00:34:55.433 --> 00:34:59.133
-Brother Ismail, what's up?
-I'm fine. You?

00:35:01.267 --> 00:35:04.267
Come on, run, run, run.
Come on Ismail!

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.633
My God!

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.367
What's up officer, couldn't you sleep?

00:36:23.067 --> 00:36:24.233
Mecnun.

00:36:28.233 --> 00:36:30.200
I am talking to you. Mecnun!

00:36:32.133 --> 00:36:37.267
-Yes, dad.
-You are a married man with kids.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.200
Many years have gone by.

00:36:41.367 --> 00:36:42.667
Forget about her already.

00:36:43.033 --> 00:36:45.500
What about her, dad?

00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:51.100
I've been there too.

00:36:51.733 --> 00:36:53.400
Don't lie to me.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.467
Go to sleep and rest a little. Now.

00:37:02.233 --> 00:37:03.367
Go on.

00:37:10.167 --> 00:37:14.700
I think we should have the little one
circumcised this summer, dad.

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:18.567
Of course we should, he is a grown man.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:26.000
Should we have it done in the garden or
organize a party at Mr. Bahri's place?

00:37:33.233 --> 00:37:35.200
I will take care of it.

00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:41.067
You should go and rest now, son.

00:37:44.267 --> 00:37:49.167
You have never hugged me like this even
once, dad.

00:38:15.667 --> 00:38:21.067
Daddy! Daddy!

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.600
What daddy? Who are you?

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.567
Get out of here!

00:38:26.633 --> 00:38:29.767
Are these toys still popular?
Don't you have any light sabers?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.433
Look at him! How can I be your father?
You don't look like me! Go away!

00:38:36.233 --> 00:38:38.467
I'm like an emigrant at my own house.

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:42.000
Haven't I left home yet?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.233
Here is Leyla.

00:39:49.167 --> 00:39:51.100
-Son!
-Grandpa! Is that you?

00:39:51.233 --> 00:39:52.633
So you found me here as well!

00:39:52.733 --> 00:39:56.667
Dear son! It has been exactly 12 years.

00:39:56.733 --> 00:39:59.367
You never stopped coming here every day.

00:40:00.733 --> 00:40:03.600
She never stopped, Grandpa.
She didn't give up, either.

00:40:04.233 --> 00:40:06.633
She always comes here.

00:40:07.633 --> 00:40:09.300
"Her love has not abandoned me"

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.033
"I'm hungry. I'm thirsty, sir"

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.133
"I'm an civil servant now, I have roots
but her love hasn't abandoned me"

00:40:16.533 --> 00:40:21.367
Do you know that today is their wedding
anniversary, Grandpa?

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.767
How do you know?

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.400
Because we got married on the
same day.

00:40:27.033 --> 00:40:29.100
How lucky you are.

00:40:30.233 --> 00:40:34.267
You will never forget your anniversary
this way.

00:40:36.633 --> 00:40:41.233
I'm just saying you should look on
the bright side of things.

00:40:42.533 --> 00:40:47.800
Son! You are a responsible person.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.100
You have a family. Think about
your home, your wife, your kids.

00:40:54.333 --> 00:40:56.033
I think about them Grandpa.

00:40:56.233 --> 00:41:00.233
I do but... It's like...

00:41:01.267 --> 00:41:06.167
It's like the past is
always chasing after me Grandpa.

00:41:06.233 --> 00:41:11.067
-Yes, exactly! It's right behind you.
-What are you talking about?

00:41:13.033 --> 00:41:14.100
Uh? What do you mean?

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.567
I mean...

00:41:16.367 --> 00:41:20.100
You are going to be late to work.
Do you want to get fired?

00:41:20.167 --> 00:41:21.167
Grandpa!

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.100
What do we have to lose other than
our lunchboxes?

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.733
You have a family.

00:41:28.433 --> 00:41:31.567
I would love to show you what would
happen to them

00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:37.400
if you lost your job but since you gave
my stick away, it's not possible.

00:41:37.633 --> 00:41:40.467
The stick again, Grandpa!

00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:42.600
It's been 12 years. 12 years.

00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:46.533
-It's because of you!
-Enough already!

00:41:47.267 --> 00:41:51.100
For God's sake! You won't ever grow
tired of reminding me of this.

00:42:25.467 --> 00:42:28.233
Grandpa, there she is.
Why didn't you tell me where she was?

00:42:28.533 --> 00:42:32.000
Son! Now you are two people.
What am I supposed to do with you?

00:42:33.767 --> 00:42:36.033
-Leyla!
-Stop son, where are you going?

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.767
Why are you stopping me Grandpa?
I will go and talk to Leyla.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:45.733
Don't. Don't tell her anything;
she'll think you're crazy.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.067
Let's get out of here at once.

00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:51.767
I will talk to her for two minutes.
What's the big deal?

00:42:52.567 --> 00:42:56.633
-Mommy!
-My lovely girl!

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.667
Mommy? Did she call her mommy?

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.567
What did you expect?

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.733
It has been so long. She's moved
on with her life.

00:43:08.333 --> 00:43:10.533
Come on son. Let's get out of here
at once.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.567
Since you're in such a hurry, there is
definitely something going on.

00:43:14.667 --> 00:43:17.500
What is it Grandpa? What else is there?

00:43:19.533 --> 00:43:21.400
Isn't it Arda?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.500
Did she marry Arda?

00:43:24.567 --> 00:43:26.800
Is this their daughter?

00:43:27.667 --> 00:43:33.167
She even had a child from him.
And she got married. Leyla!

00:43:33.233 --> 00:43:35.000
I wish you had given birth to me
instead of that child.

00:43:35.067 --> 00:43:37.433
I'd rather call you mom!
I wish I didn't love you this much!

00:43:37.633 --> 00:43:39.000
I wish I loved someone else!
-Son!

00:43:39.067 --> 00:43:42.233
-What do you want Arda?
-What! Can't I see my wife!

00:43:43.633 --> 00:43:45.733
Watch the ducks, my love.

00:43:47.267 --> 00:43:49.600
I don't understand why you come here
every day.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600
Never mind.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.467
-We are meeting tonight, right?
-Why?

00:43:57.667 --> 00:44:02.100
What do you mean? You never
remember our wedding anniversary.

00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:07.433
Anyway, I'll pick you up at eight.

00:44:07.767 --> 00:44:11.633
Don't be late. You know I hate it. Ok?

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.667
You know what? Isn't this place
ridiculous?

00:44:15.733 --> 00:44:17.067
There are pools and everything.

00:44:17.133 --> 00:44:20.000
Want to build a residence here?
Or maybe a parking garage?

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.100
It would be great.

00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:26.767
Don't worry son. My time machine is
almost in working condition.

00:44:27.267 --> 00:44:30.267
If we're lucky, you'll be home tonight.
You can have tea at home.

00:44:30.433 --> 00:44:32.200
-Will it really work?
-Yes, of course.

00:44:32.767 --> 00:44:34.567
What does this time machine run on? Gas?

00:44:34.667 --> 00:44:39.500
What d'ya mean gas? Who uses gas
anymore? It runs on plutonium.

00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:44.200
We should remember to get some
plutonium before we leave

00:44:44.267 --> 00:44:46.000
so that we don't get stranded on the way.

00:44:46.067 --> 00:44:48.733
Isn't plutonium radioactive
or nuclear, Grandpa?

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.133
It's all nuclear things now. Everything is
nuclear.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.100
Ok but where will you find it? Do you buy
nuclear material from a store?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.267
Grandpa, we have uranium, zirconium,
torium, and krypton.

00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:04.033
They've just been delivered. My aunt sent
some from the village. Still fresh.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.800
Kaan! What are you doing?

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.767
This a grocery store!

00:45:09.067 --> 00:45:13.400
It's 2023 son. Nuclear stuff is all the
rage. Everything is nuclear.

00:45:13.733 --> 00:45:17.000
Kaan, any plutonium, son?

00:45:17.533 --> 00:45:19.167
-Unfortunately no, Grandpa.
-Why?

00:45:19.467 --> 00:45:22.467
There's a market shortage,
we won't get any before long.

00:45:24.233 --> 00:45:26.767
We can't manage with the amount we have.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:32.000
You should have built a machine that runs
on gas or water, Grandpa.

00:45:32.067 --> 00:45:36.167
Why did you build a nuclear one?
How does it work, what is it's system?

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.533
After you put in the plutonium, you get
into the car and start the engine.

00:45:41.733 --> 00:45:46.267
When you reach the desired speed
your time travel begins.

00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:47.367
What if it doesn't work?

00:45:47.433 --> 00:45:49.167
Then you won't have to worry about much.

00:45:49.233 --> 00:45:51.733
You'll have already been
split into your atoms.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.767
Really! How very comforting.
Thank you Grandpa.

00:45:55.567 --> 00:45:57.733
What is he doing?

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:03.033
Ismail! Wake up son.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:09.033
What is it Grandpa, am I in the past now?

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:11.600
But you are still the same.
Is this the recent past?

00:46:11.767 --> 00:46:14.333
Which past are you talking about!
You were sleeping inside.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:20.600
But I was going to go to the past.
I wanted to have a little time trip.

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:24.500
I have never seen a dinosaur; I thought
maybe I would see some dinosaurs.

00:46:25.033 --> 00:46:27.033
I got into this car to travel to the past
but some time actually passed.

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:29.133
-Some time has passed.
-Yes, time has passed.

00:46:29.233 --> 00:46:35.233
Time has passed, I see.
What am I doing here?

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.500
-Do dinosaurs come close to you?
-Yes, they do. They come very close.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.167
-Why couldn't I see the dinosaurs?
-You can see me!

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.800
-You can't go in.
-Why not? Step aside brother.

00:47:01.033 --> 00:47:03.300
-What are you going to do inside?
-I want to walk in the park.

00:47:03.367 --> 00:47:05.233
You can't enter alone. This is a
family park.

00:47:05.367 --> 00:47:06.567
-A family park?
-Yes.

00:47:06.633 --> 00:47:09.500
-What is a family park? Is it like a bar?
-Get out of my way.

00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:12.267
Get out of here. I can't let you in.
There are people with children inside.

00:47:12.333 --> 00:47:15.633
I also have children.
I have many children.

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:17.467
Where are they!

00:47:17.533 --> 00:47:18.600
I left the house in a hurry.

00:47:18.667 --> 00:47:21.733
I forgot them at home. Let me in and
I'll bring them later.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.267
I can't let you in without a child.
Go away.

00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:27.633
What the hell!

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.133
Darling, son, my dear child.

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.633
Here, take your toy.

00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:50.500
What is this? Damn it.

00:47:52.533 --> 00:47:54.033
Ali Nazik!

00:47:56.067 --> 00:47:59.200
Come here. Breakfast is ready.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.800
I wasn't going to steal him.

00:48:01.033 --> 00:48:03.067
I was going to put him back where he was,
I swear.

00:48:03.133 --> 00:48:05.433
Mecnun! Haven't you gone to work?

00:48:07.467 --> 00:48:11.067
It's vaccination day so they gave us the
afternoon off. That's why.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.400
What is this outfit?

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.733
What about it? Casual.

00:48:16.533 --> 00:48:17.567
Did you...

00:48:19.033 --> 00:48:20.233
...shave your mustache!

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.067
It was always itching dad.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.500
I thought I'd better shave it.

00:48:26.667 --> 00:48:29.533
-Where are your glasses?
-I see fine.

00:48:32.033 --> 00:48:34.000
What's with your hair?
What have you done?

00:48:34.067 --> 00:48:37.267
-Isn't it better this way!
-No, it's not.

00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:40.533
Come on, the breakfast is ready.
Let the child go.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.667
I will take the child to the park so
he can get some fresh air and play.

00:48:43.733 --> 00:48:45.333
He is hungry, son. Let him go!

00:48:52.467 --> 00:48:57.333
Mecnun, why don't you eat something son?
Why do you behave like a stranger?

00:48:58.067 --> 00:48:59.067
No.

00:48:59.333 --> 00:49:00.500
No, what!

00:49:00.567 --> 00:49:02.233
No, mom.

00:49:02.767 --> 00:49:05.033
No? No what, son?

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.200
I'm not a stranger at all.
I'm your son, mom.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.100
Mecnun! Are you ok?

00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:12.167
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

00:49:12.333 --> 00:49:16.200
What are you talking about?
Tell me the truth, have you been fired?

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.267
No dad, why would I be fired from my
awesome job at...

00:49:20.467 --> 00:49:23.333
I mean my job...

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.800
Being a civil servant
is my favorite thing.

00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:28.133
Why would I be fired?

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.600
If he's had enough now, can we go out
to the park?

00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:34.400
He's home all day without fresh air.

00:49:34.467 --> 00:49:38.767
Ok, take Iskender and Pakize.
Go have some fresh air all together.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.233
-Who and who?
-Iskender and Pakize.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:45.067
Are my children called Iskender and
Pakize?

00:49:45.133 --> 00:49:50.767
You are very creative with the names dad.
I don't even want to talk about Ali Nazik.

00:49:55.033 --> 00:49:57.567
Here are the kids. Do I leave them
with you?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.700
I'm a dad!

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.133
Ok, pass.

00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:24.467
Mecnun!

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.067
Go ahead and play, children.
Don't get lost, ok?

00:50:35.367 --> 00:50:36.633
Leyla?

00:50:39.767 --> 00:50:41.233
Leyla?

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.000
What are you doing here?
Why did you come?

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.467
Leyla...

00:50:47.767 --> 00:50:51.333
I have to talk to you.
I have things to tell to you.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.333
12 years later.

00:50:54.267 --> 00:50:57.433
You waited 12 years and now you
have things to tell me!

00:50:57.533 --> 00:51:02.800
It's not what you think it is Leyla.
How should I tell you?

00:51:03.267 --> 00:51:08.533
Leyla, I am not actually me. It's not me.

00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:14.567
Bravo, this is a terrific entrance,
really. It was worth waiting for.

00:51:14.633 --> 00:51:16.800
Sorry, I interrupted.
I'm really curious where this is going.

00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:20.233
Could you please take me seriously Leyla?
I'm trying to explain something here.

00:51:20.567 --> 00:51:22.300
There is nothing to explain Mecnun.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:23.767
It's all over.

00:51:24.133 --> 00:51:26.467
And it has been over for a long time.

00:51:26.733 --> 00:51:29.767
Now we are two people waking up to
different mornings.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:36.333
I want to discuss why this happened,
Leyla.

00:51:36.533 --> 00:51:38.533
If you didn't get married to that man

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.233
I wouldn't have gotten married.
It's all because of you.

00:51:41.733 --> 00:51:43.600
-So I'm the guilty one, right?
-Yes.

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:46.133
So you had kids because of me.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.167
It happened by mistake.

00:51:49.033 --> 00:51:51.167
-All three of them!
-No, the first one happened by mistake.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.767
After that, the others came.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:01.100
Please take off your glasses.
I really don't get what you're saying.

00:52:01.433 --> 00:52:05.100
Just a second, so you don't know
why I'm wearing these glasses!

00:52:05.167 --> 00:52:06.267
No.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.800
How about your sudden departure then?
Everything we lived together?

00:52:11.333 --> 00:52:16.033
Everything we lived together? What's this?
I don't know anything about it.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.500
What did we live together?
What happened between us?

00:52:19.567 --> 00:52:20.700
You are not telling me.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:26.233
You don't even know what we have gone
through. You are a real asshole.

00:52:27.567 --> 00:52:29.733
After you left, I swore

00:52:30.633 --> 00:52:33.467
never to look at the world with my
naked eyes again.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.767
I decided to live in my own dark world
without you.

00:52:37.233 --> 00:52:40.100
Why is that! Gosh, I'm sorry but
this is nonsense.

00:52:40.167 --> 00:52:43.367
I'm sorry but you have become a very
ridiculous person Leyla.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.133
I intrude in your dreams and call you
but you tell me your heart is broken.

00:52:47.233 --> 00:52:50.300
I came to the future for you.
What else can I do?

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:54.133
But you tell me you live in the dark and
you can't get out. What is this, Leyla!

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.600
I can't understand you anymore.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:02.767
You put on those glasses. Have you
really been wearing them for 12 years?

00:53:03.433 --> 00:53:05.533
-Yes, that's right.
-You really never took them off?

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.600
No, I didn't.

00:53:06.667 --> 00:53:09.467
Not even when you were sleeping or
while taking a shower!

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.233
-No, I keep wearing them.
-But they would have left a mark.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.700
They have. There is a dent here.

00:53:12.767 --> 00:53:18.233
No wonder. Those glasses are big.
You could have used smaller ones.

00:53:18.667 --> 00:53:20.533
Big!

00:53:21.533 --> 00:53:23.033
Shame on you.

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.233
You really aren't worth any of this.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.267
Shame? Leyla, where are you going?

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.267
Leyla you got me wrong.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.800
Sevim! Come here honey, we're leaving.

00:53:35.033 --> 00:53:36.600
Sevim!

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.433
Sevim!

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.700
Did you name your daughter after your
mother, Leyla? I can't believe it.

00:53:42.767 --> 00:53:45.500
I really can't believe it.
Be a little more creative.

00:53:45.667 --> 00:53:48.067
My mother died the month my
daughter was born, Mecnun.

00:53:50.667 --> 00:53:51.800
I'm very sorry.

00:53:52.267 --> 00:53:54.433
My deepest condolences, Leyla.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.300
Come here sweetheart, come.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.033
Sevim!

00:54:11.167 --> 00:54:15.333
Grandpa, maybe we should put in some
orange juice for it to work.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.500
Fresh orange juice is a vitamin bomb.
What do you say? Should we try?

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.167
Brother Ismail!

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.300
Any luck? Does it look like
it's going to work?

00:54:25.367 --> 00:54:27.633
No Mecnun, Grandpa
still hasn't been able to fix it.

00:54:28.033 --> 00:54:31.433
He's been working all morning
but still nothing...

00:54:31.767 --> 00:54:33.567
It seems like you're going to stay here,
you can't go anywhere.

00:54:33.633 --> 00:54:35.767
Ismail! I'm going to hit you on the head
with a stick.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.533
-Ok, fine.
-Son!

00:54:39.733 --> 00:54:42.467
-Where have you been?
-I went to see Leyla, Grandpa.

00:54:43.033 --> 00:54:46.300
And I tried to return to the past
but I couldn't.

00:54:46.367 --> 00:54:47.367
How so?

00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:52.167
<i>Good afternoon, I want to buy</i>
<i>a one-way ticket, student fare.</i>

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.367
<i>But I want to go back 12 years.</i>

00:54:56.533 --> 00:54:58.800
<i>The precise date is not important but...</i>

00:54:59.033 --> 00:55:03.333
<i>It would be great to go back to May 2011.</i>
<i>If possible.</i>

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:08.600
<i>Just in case, please don't call me</i>
<i>a maniac. You are a maniac yourself.</i>

00:55:09.533 --> 00:55:13.533
What can I do Grandpa! At least I tried.
I am stuck here.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.533
Did you talk to Leyla?
Did you tell her everything?

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:23.033
I did but not much. Something happened.
She got angry, she yelled at me.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.167
She is acting weird.
I don't even know why we broke up.

00:55:27.667 --> 00:55:31.700
Is it because she lent you money and you
forgot to pay her back?

00:55:32.133 --> 00:55:35.000
No, I would never do that.
I always pay my debts.

00:55:35.067 --> 00:55:37.100
I am thinking about talking to myself,
Grandpa.

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:41.133
I will learn all that has happened.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.500
Don't you dare! Never do such a thing.

00:55:43.567 --> 00:55:46.733
-Why?
-If you run into yourself,

00:55:47.133 --> 00:55:51.433
you can ruin all the balances and
cause irreversible problems.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.800
I can't return either way, Grandpa.
I'm stuck here. What can happen?

00:55:55.033 --> 00:55:56.667
Will I upset him?

00:55:56.733 --> 00:56:00.167
I don't even care, I'm about to go crazy.
Think of me a little.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.533
That's why I'm concerned.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:07.633
Think of me here, not the other me.
Me, the one without a mustache.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.600
Besides, what a hideous mustache that is.
Why do I wear it? Why didn't you step in?

00:56:12.667 --> 00:56:14.600
-I told you.
-What did you tell me?

00:56:14.733 --> 00:56:16.800
I told you not to wear a mustache.

00:56:17.033 --> 00:56:19.267
I told you to do something but
why did you go to the 1950's?

00:56:19.467 --> 00:56:20.800
Why did I turn out this way?

00:56:21.033 --> 00:56:24.667
Is it because I wanted to join
some retro band?

00:56:24.733 --> 00:56:26.600
You saw it in the movie
<i>Once Upon a Time in America</i> .

00:56:26.767 --> 00:56:28.400
How can I be like this?

00:56:28.467 --> 00:56:33.800
Don't worry son, we'll ask all the
neighbors for plutonium, if necessary.

00:56:34.033 --> 00:56:35.133
We'll find it somehow.

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.700
Why don't we buy it from the store run
by the guy with glasses?

00:56:38.767 --> 00:56:41.500
We went there but he didn't have any.
He said we couldn't find it anywhere.

00:56:41.633 --> 00:56:47.100
Grandpa! Don't you know the guy?
He's a real smartass.

00:56:47.433 --> 00:56:54.167
He must be saving it for the black market.
Let's go and talk to him nicely.

00:56:54.233 --> 00:56:55.500
Nicely!

00:56:56.433 --> 00:56:58.433
What the hell Kaan, are you a black
marketeer now?

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.333
I'm an elder brother to you.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.367
I know it doesn't look like that but I was
your elder brother.

00:57:04.067 --> 00:57:05.233
Brother Ismail!

00:57:05.567 --> 00:57:08.067
I really don't have any plutonium.

00:57:08.333 --> 00:57:10.700
You've become a real hotshot in this
business world, Kaan.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.700
Mecnun, come here and hold him like this.

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.333
I also want to ask him a few questions.
Please.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.133
You are asking so nicely.
-Wait a little! He's about to dissolve.

00:57:18.567 --> 00:57:20.533
Brother Ismail! It hurts a lot!

00:57:20.633 --> 00:57:23.533
I really don't have plutonium but
I know someone who has.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.600
Who?

00:57:36.467 --> 00:57:37.633
Brother Erdal.

00:57:42.667 --> 00:57:46.200
-What is this?
-What happened to you Erdal?

00:57:46.433 --> 00:57:49.000
Mecnun? Ismail?

00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:51.100
What's with you?

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:53.200
What do you mean? What's this?

00:57:54.333 --> 00:57:55.700
What's happened to you?

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.367
Has my eyeliner smudged?

00:57:57.567 --> 00:58:02.133
What eyeliner? How? You look disgusting!
Why?

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.233
You are making such a big deal of it,
Mecnun! It's like you have never seen me.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.233
-Where was I supposed to see you?
-Welcome guys.

00:58:09.533 --> 00:58:11.400
Let me pour you a drink.

00:58:12.267 --> 00:58:14.167
-Sex on the bus!
-Who?

00:58:15.733 --> 00:58:20.167
No, give me fresh orange juice, straight.

00:58:21.133 --> 00:58:22.167
And you, Mecnun?

00:58:22.367 --> 00:58:26.800
Erdal, if it's no trouble,
I'll have a little plutonium.

00:58:33.367 --> 00:58:35.700
-Plutonium!
-Yes.

00:58:40.733 --> 00:58:42.400
Why should I have any plutonium?

00:58:42.467 --> 00:58:44.600
Don't lie to us, we know everything.

00:58:44.767 --> 00:58:46.433
If you don't want to give it to us,
that's something else.

00:58:46.633 --> 00:58:51.667
Then we'll see if your elder brother
finds out about you.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.167
Mecnun, what kind of talk is this?

00:58:57.733 --> 00:58:59.000
Someone will hear you.

00:58:59.067 --> 00:59:01.600
Then give us the plutonium. What are you
going to do with plutonium anyway?

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:12.033
-We use it for treatment only.
-What treatment?

00:59:13.433 --> 00:59:17.733
Nurten and I have been
trying to have a child for a while.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.067
We've been treated with it.

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.000
I read about it somewhere.
It's used only for medical purposes.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:27.000
Were you trying to have a nuclear baby?
I don't get it.

00:59:27.267 --> 00:59:30.533
I'm telling you, I read this.
It was just an attempt.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.633
We tried everything. So we tried
plutonium, too.

00:59:32.767 --> 00:59:36.000
We even tried locust beans.
We tried everything.

00:59:36.367 --> 00:59:40.000
So, can we have the plutonium now?
We could ue a shot, if you have any.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.467
Erdal, do beautiful girls come here?
Should I come every weekend?

00:59:44.567 --> 00:59:46.200
Brother Ismail, please.

00:59:49.567 --> 00:59:53.167
Honestly dad, if you continue
like this we'll have you sign up

00:59:53.233 --> 00:59:55.567
at the chamber of agriculture next month.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.200
Shut up. If you helped me, we could
sign up together.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.233
What is it?

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.033
What?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.600
-Your mustache.
-What about it?

01:00:10.267 --> 01:00:14.233
-Didn't you shave it?
-No, dad. Why would I do that?

01:00:18.067 --> 01:00:20.000
Mecnun, what is it with you these days?

01:00:20.067 --> 01:00:22.000
This is so offensive.
What are you trying to say?

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.067
-Vaccination.
-What vaccination?

01:00:27.233 --> 01:00:31.000
You are certainly up to something.
Where is Grandpa?

01:00:31.133 --> 01:00:32.767
He is most probably in the garage.

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:41.033
Grandpa! We found the promarium!

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.333
-What?
-I can't say it! Pro...

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.767
-Proletariat.
-It's not proletariat.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.500
-We repeated this 15 times on the way.
-What can I do, I can't say it.

01:00:49.567 --> 01:00:51.300
I'll be damned if I can remember it,
too!

01:00:51.633 --> 01:00:54.400
-Plutonium!
-We got plutonium and sweets.

01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:56.767
Sweets! What will we do with sweets?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.167
Grandpa, we are going there,
we can't go empty-handed.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.467
We'll go from here all the way there.
It's a tradition to take a box of sweets.

01:01:04.533 --> 01:01:08.000
Ismail, you are not going my son.
Only Mecnun is.

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:11.533
How so?

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:14.300
I don't care! I will go too.
Mecnun? Grandpa?

01:01:14.467 --> 01:01:17.767
No son, no. You belong here. You can't go.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.800
I'll go too! Why shouldn't I?

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.033
I swear I'll go, too.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.033
Here, I locked the door.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.767
I swear I won't give you the key.
I will go too. Why is only Mecnun going?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.533
Why am I supposed to be alone here?
I will go too!

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.800
Brother Ismail, what are you doing?

01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:35.633
He's crying like a baby, for God's sake!
Come to your senses! You are a big boy.

01:01:36.133 --> 01:01:37.200
He's taken the key and he's crying.

01:01:37.267 --> 01:01:40.567
Why are you doing this Brother Ismail?
What do you want from me?

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.200
-I want to come, too.
-Why?

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.100
I'm so lonely here.

01:01:49.233 --> 01:01:52.133
Everyone has his own life.
I'm all by myself.

01:01:52.733 --> 01:01:56.567
Ismail, you belong to this time frame,
son. You can't go.

01:01:56.633 --> 01:02:01.333
I don't belong here. I don't want
this time nor this world.

01:02:02.733 --> 01:02:04.433
I want my friends!

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.633
I want it to be like in the old days!

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.633
I miss the old days so much!

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.467
Brother Ismail, please don't cry.

01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:16.133
You'll make me cry, too.
You're breaking my heart.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:20.400
There is already one there,
Brother Ismail.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.167
If we take you there, there'll be two.

01:02:23.367 --> 01:02:25.100
Is this right, Brother Ismail?

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:27.300
It would be the end of us!
Think of us, too!

01:02:27.467 --> 01:02:29.100
The world is not ready for this.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.800
Brother Ismail, you are not
listening to me.

01:02:31.033 --> 01:02:35.167
-I am.
-Please don't cry. It makes me so sad.

01:02:35.233 --> 01:02:36.733
-Ok. I'm not crying.
-Don't cry.

01:02:37.467 --> 01:02:42.733
Brother Ismail has friends there...
I'll see him there when I go.

01:02:43.033 --> 01:02:44.300
Do you understand? Right, Grandpa?

01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:50.233
Sure! Mecnun is right. If Mecnun is
all right, none of this will ever happen.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.467
-Really?
-Of course! I will do you a huge favor.

01:02:55.767 --> 01:03:02.733
If you have something to tell Ismail,
I mean from 12 years ago...

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:07.200
It can be a warning, you can tell him to
do or not to do something or...

01:03:07.267 --> 01:03:12.033
you may have suggestions. I'll tell them
all to Ismail there when I go.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.600
-Will you really?
-I'll be damned if I don't?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.300
Ok then.

01:03:20.533 --> 01:03:22.367
Tell him about me.

01:03:25.233 --> 01:03:26.367
Is that all?

01:03:26.433 --> 01:03:31.200
And give him these sweets. I love
sweets so much, he'll eat them too.

01:03:31.467 --> 01:03:33.000
Here are four boxes, take them.

01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:37.067
Take this one too.

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:42.000
Ok, I'm off then.

01:03:42.633 --> 01:03:44.533
I have a long and hard trip ahead of me.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.533
If you'll excuse me.

01:03:50.067 --> 01:03:51.600
In the name of God the merciful!

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.133
Do it, Mecnun!

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.433
Go in peace and return in peace.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.567
Grandpa! Is this water bubbling?

01:04:08.767 --> 01:04:13.200
Grandpa! It's not working!
To hell with your car!

01:04:13.567 --> 01:04:16.133
Gosh! We did all the necessary.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.267
We put in the plutonium, too.
What did we miss?

01:04:19.533 --> 01:04:23.133
I'm stuck in the middle of 2023!

01:04:23.633 --> 01:04:28.500
Don't worry guys. We'll just push it down
the hill and it will start.

01:04:28.633 --> 01:04:30.433
-Dad!
-Yes, dad.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.500
And you tell me you're not up to
something. I know you well, son.

01:04:36.567 --> 01:04:40.667
-Can I explain everything?
-There is nothing to explain. I got it.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.100
The real Mecnun is home and
you are Mecnun from the past.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.500
And this is the time machine that
Grandpa has built.

01:04:49.067 --> 01:04:50.800
Now we'll push it downhill

01:04:51.033 --> 01:04:55.000
so you'll go back to the past and continue
being a punk. That's it!

01:04:55.133 --> 01:04:58.800
You figured it out all on your own?

01:04:59.367 --> 01:05:01.500
-Yes.
-And does it sound reasonable to you?

01:05:01.567 --> 01:05:05.700
No but still, give it a try. Whatever!

01:05:06.133 --> 01:05:10.367
I can't deal with you all night! Get on
with it already. And you, stop watching.

01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:14.133
Come on!

01:05:16.133 --> 01:05:18.133
One, two, three, push!

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.233
Change the gear to neutral.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:24.733
Change the gear to neutral.
You're killing us. My back!

01:05:31.033 --> 01:05:33.533
For God's sake!

01:05:39.167 --> 01:05:41.267
No, dad. It's not working.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:47.467
Don't worry. Once I catch my breath,
I'll make it work downhill. Don't worry.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.100
How will you do that, dad? How can we
start a time machine like that?

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.367
We can't go back even for two hours with
this, let alone 12 years!

01:05:55.433 --> 01:05:59.600
There's no giving up! I'll start
from the beginning and...

01:05:59.667 --> 01:06:01.800
build you a new time machine,
if necessary.

01:06:02.267 --> 01:06:06.433
No, Grandpa. Don't bother. I'm ok.
I have decided. I'll stay here, really.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.233
I'll find a nice job here and talk to
myself, too. No problem.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.200
-You'll have two sons.
-No, no, no, no. For God's sake!

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.667
I can't take two Mecnuns in
a quarter of a century!

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.200
No, Mecnun! We'll send you back!
Don't you worry!

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.567
-How?
-How?

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:26.100
We'll gather the gang,
just like in the old days.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.567
How did you all make it here so fast?

01:06:55.033 --> 01:06:58.267
I'm really scared. How can this be?

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.767
Dad, what are you doing?

01:07:06.467 --> 01:07:07.633
What is this pose?

01:07:09.033 --> 01:07:11.100
It just mean we have team spirit.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:21.300
It's great that we're all here
but what is this about exactly?

01:07:21.367 --> 01:07:22.433
What are we going to do?

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:39.800
Stop! Listen to me! Look, only these two
know what happened between

01:07:40.033 --> 01:07:45.567
Leyla and Mecnun. I mean,
the other Mecnun and Leyla.

01:07:45.633 --> 01:07:48.133
We have to bring them together.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.433
And how will we learn what happened?

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:58.133
We'll bring them together somehow and
then we'll find a way to get the stick.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.700
Right! Arda is Leyla's husband after all.
Leyla will get it somehow.

01:08:04.233 --> 01:08:09.300
Did you say husband? Why do you use
that word? That hurts so much.

01:08:09.733 --> 01:08:11.000
Just a minute.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.333
Are we trying to separate Leyla and Arda?

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.467
Yes.

01:08:16.433 --> 01:08:19.033
No way.

01:08:19.267 --> 01:08:23.100
Whoever breaks up a family
will never have a family.

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:27.700
It's not what you think, Erdal.
It's very very complicated.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.333
How will we bring these two together!

01:08:43.033 --> 01:08:44.767
Excuse me, son! Can you come here?

01:08:45.267 --> 01:08:46.633
Come here.

01:08:49.533 --> 01:08:50.767
I got the package. We're on our way!

01:09:21.033 --> 01:09:23.333
Dad, don't talk that way.
What's a package?

01:09:23.767 --> 01:09:26.000
I got excited. I don't know
what I'm saying.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.067
We'll be there in a second.

01:09:29.133 --> 01:09:31.600
What a stupid thing this is! I feel
like a moron with this in my ear.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:42.167
Grandpa, what do you think?
Will this work out?

01:09:43.367 --> 01:09:45.733
It will for sure.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.400
I mean it has to.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:50.133
I hope it works out.

01:09:51.633 --> 01:09:53.233
What do I know! Look at me.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.367
I'm a total wreck now that
they've taken away my stick.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.567
Why do you say that?

01:09:56.633 --> 01:09:59.700
I swear it is better this way.
Your face has brightened.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.700
-Really!
-I'll be damned if I'm lying. I swear.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:09.400
What was that silly beard of yours?
Now you look cool.

01:10:11.567 --> 01:10:14.767
Mecnun, you should come.
We'll have so much fun.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.533
I would love to respond positively
to this offer,

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.767
my friend but I work tomorrow.

01:10:22.067 --> 01:10:28.067
What a hideous, dull, stubborn guy
you are! I wish you were gone and

01:10:28.133 --> 01:10:31.233
the other Mecnun stayed here.
How annoying can you be.

01:10:31.367 --> 01:10:34.000
-What do you mean, the other Mecnun?
-Ha!

01:10:34.267 --> 01:10:35.367
What do you mean, the other Mecnun?

01:10:35.433 --> 01:10:37.800
The other Mecnun! Who's that?

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.333
You just used those words, Ismail.

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:43.367
No I didn't used those words.
It's not what I said.

01:10:43.433 --> 01:10:46.667
The words that come out

01:10:46.733 --> 01:10:49.700
of my mouth are not the same as the
ones your ears hear. I didn't say this.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.633
-Come on. We'll have so much fun.
-Ismail,

01:10:51.733 --> 01:10:54.300
you are bullying me now, please.

01:10:56.733 --> 01:11:00.000
I swear I'll hit you on the head
real hard!

01:11:00.433 --> 01:11:03.767
Ismail, you're a bad influence.

01:11:04.133 --> 01:11:06.400
Ok, I'll change my shoes and
come right away.

01:11:17.033 --> 01:11:18.733
Is it you, Uncle Iskender?

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.300
Not at all! Who is Uncle Iskender, missy?
I don't know no Iskender.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.533
I don't even have any sons.
I have six daughters.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.167
-I'm sorry!
-I mean three. Or two.

01:11:35.733 --> 01:11:41.133
I think she understood who I am.
Should I kill her?

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.767
<i>Should I kill her?</i>

01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:47.333
Gosh, Dad! Why would you kill her?
Stop this kind of behavior!

01:11:47.567 --> 01:11:51.033
Just bring her here! That's it.

01:11:51.133 --> 01:11:54.067
If you know it all, you should have done
this yourself, you moron!

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.133
See how this old man talks! Shame on
you, daddy! There's a girl around.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.367
Don't talk like that in front of her.

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:33.000
-Is Arda here?
-No but he'll be here any minute. Come in.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.733
Come in? Are you a secretary?
How stupid can you be! Look at him!

01:12:43.767 --> 01:12:45.067
You nitwit!

01:12:45.133 --> 01:12:46.767
Something will go wrong, Grandpa.
It just won't work out.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.067
Remember the old days and never lose
hope, or else you won't survive.

01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:57.033
In the old days you had a beard Grandpa.
You were credible but now look at you!

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.500
What kind of a face is this?
What a silly hairstyle!

01:12:58.567 --> 01:13:01.067
You look so weird, I can't believe you.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.233
I am very stressed out right now.
I'm uncomfortable.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.733
Go in. I'll join you shortly, I promise.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.300
You see Grandpa, I brought Mecnun.

01:13:39.133 --> 01:13:42.767
-But you have become so fussy!
-Really?

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:49.567
You have really become a disgusting
person. I swear I'm sick of you.

01:13:49.633 --> 01:13:54.200
-But why! I wasn't like this before.
-You were a promising boy.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:02.567
-Mecnun, is that you?
-Good evening, madam.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.633
Nice. Why did you bring me here?

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:14.767
Madam, did I bring you here?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.200
On the contrary, I was forced
to come here.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.133
Ok then, we can leave.

01:14:37.433 --> 01:14:39.600
-She's leaving!
-No.

01:14:41.233 --> 01:14:42.400
Have you put on weight?

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.167
And you're talking weird.
You have grown a mustache.

01:14:46.567 --> 01:14:48.167
What's this? What's going on?

01:14:48.367 --> 01:14:49.400
What's wrong, Madam?

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:53.467
You're all obsessed with my mustache.
What's all this fuss about?

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:55.200
Let me pass.

01:14:56.167 --> 01:14:58.633
-Please stop being so distant.
-Never.

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:02.400
Tell me everything that happened.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.733
Grandpa, forgive my curiosity
but did you organize this?

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.700
Yes, I did. It's all me.
Of course I got support from friends.

01:15:12.767 --> 01:15:14.767
It's teamwork.

01:15:15.367 --> 01:15:19.200
Anyway, tell me why you two broke up.

01:15:19.567 --> 01:15:26.533
Sir, love requires sacrifice.

01:15:27.433 --> 01:15:33.700
If I hadn't left Leyla, they were going to
kill her beloved father.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.667
-They were going to kill my father?
-Yes.

01:15:39.733 --> 01:15:42.467
It was me who made a sacrifice!
I broke up with you so that

01:15:42.533 --> 01:15:45.600
your house wouldn't be demolished.

01:15:46.467 --> 01:15:47.800
What?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
<i>Did you talk to Arda's father, dad?</i>

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.700
<i>I did, my daughter.</i>

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.467
<i>And?</i>

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.233
<i>And...</i>

01:15:59.033 --> 01:16:01.033
<i>I couldn't get what I wanted most.</i>

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.267
<i>-I must have made a mistake.</i>
<i>-What are you talking about?</i>

01:16:05.767 --> 01:16:07.033
<i>It's bad, my daughter.</i>

01:16:07.433 --> 01:16:08.433
<i>He's not pulling back.</i>

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.233
<i>Don't worry. We'll find a way.</i>

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.267
<i>Mecnun is already out looking for a</i>
<i>solution.</i>

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.733
<i>Yes, so I heard.</i>

01:16:16.367 --> 01:16:19.433
<i>Mecnun sold his house to give us some</i>
<i>money.</i>

01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:22.700
<i>-What did he do?</i>
<i>-He sold his house.</i>

01:16:23.567 --> 01:16:29.667
<i>His money is not enough to cover</i>
<i>our debts but they also are poor.</i>

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.367
<i>What a pity.</i>

01:16:31.467 --> 01:16:34.667
Uncle Metin was such a disgusting man!

01:16:35.067 --> 01:16:38.000
Uncle Metin was such a disgusting man!

01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:42.633
I went to Mr. Metin when you didn't

01:16:43.467 --> 01:16:47.533
accept my money.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.300
<i>Here you go Uncle Metin.</i>

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.533
<i>There is a lot of money here.</i>
<i>I hope it's enough.</i>

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.133
<i>Even if this isn't enough, I offered it to</i>
<i>Leyla but she didn't accept it.</i>

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:06.800
<i>After you solve your financial issues,</i>
<i>you can pay me back.</i>

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.300
<i>I'll take this.</i>

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.433
<i>This isn't enough but they are going to</i>
<i>shoot me anyway.</i>

01:17:14.567 --> 01:17:15.700
<i>Shoot you!</i>

01:17:15.767 --> 01:17:17.467
<i>-Money is not the problem.</i>
<i>-No?</i>

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:18.767
<i>It's just an excuse.</i>

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.200
<i>He's set his mind on making Leyla</i>
<i>marry his son.</i>

01:17:23.733 --> 01:17:29.500
<i>They are going to shoot me just because</i>
<i>I told them Leyla loves you.</i>

01:17:31.033 --> 01:17:34.267
<i>But it's no big deal.</i>
<i>I just want you to be happy.</i>

01:17:36.733 --> 01:17:39.467
<i>Name your son Metin, ok?</i>

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.000
<i>Metin? No way!</i>

01:17:44.367 --> 01:17:50.600
I couldn't look the other way,
and so I had to leave your life, Madam.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I can't believe my father said that.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.167
But still, did you have to marry that
woman right away?

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.400
I don't know what to do in such
situations.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:07.133
That girl had come all the way from
Germany for me!

01:18:08.067 --> 01:18:10.400
And I had to forget you.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:17.367
So I decided marrying that woman
was the right thing to do.

01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:21.033
Besides, she's an excellent cook.

01:18:22.533 --> 01:18:26.700
Is that it? I could have cooked for you.
What's the big deal?

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:28.367
Come on!

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.500
I'll ask something but don't get me wrong.

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:34.133
Now he is hanging out with the girl there.

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:41.300
What if he hugs her? But not like
a friend's hug, like a lover's hug.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:45.367
Is that considered cheating?
Would you be jealous and get upset?

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.267
I don't know.

01:18:47.367 --> 01:18:50.567
He doesn't even look like me.
He's like a stranger.

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:52.100
If he hugs her...

01:18:52.167 --> 01:18:54.333
-I would still be jealous.
-Really!

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.267
-Really.
I'm also annoyed but...

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.533
Why didn't you come and tell me!

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.667
What about you, then?

01:19:03.733 --> 01:19:09.267
As soon as we broke up,

01:19:09.533 --> 01:19:12.333
the next day you threw yourself into
that weirdo's arms!

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.233
-How can you talk to me like this?
-Not at all.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.267
I have been walking around with these
19-inch glasses for

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:22.600
12 years because of you!
I never took them off!

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.400
Please, stop fighting and listen to me.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.667
You have already been apart for 12 years.
You didn't even talk to each other.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.267
You live different lives now,
but you still have a chance.

01:19:33.467 --> 01:19:35.167
I can change this.

01:19:35.267 --> 01:19:40.800
But I have to take my stick back and
Arda has my stick.

01:19:41.467 --> 01:19:44.733
How can we get my stick from Arda?

01:19:45.467 --> 01:19:46.800
I don't know. How?

01:19:47.367 --> 01:19:49.333
I don't know. Wouldn't he give it to you
if you asked him?

01:19:49.467 --> 01:19:53.633
He would never. After his father left,
he locked it to a secure room.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.500
Then how will we get the stick back?

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.300
Well!

01:20:01.167 --> 01:20:04.133
I thought the conversation would
never come to this!

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:07.367
We have been here for a while and it
would be a pity

01:20:07.433 --> 01:20:08.633
not to talk about it.

01:20:09.033 --> 01:20:11.067
When will we get this stick?

01:20:11.433 --> 01:20:13.000
Come on Nurten!

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.067
-Are you ready, Zeynep?
-I am.

01:20:55.133 --> 01:20:58.100
It's not necessary. I know the password.
It's Arda's birthday.

01:21:00.433 --> 01:21:04.000
They really are the most intelligent
people.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.800
Where is my stick?

01:21:26.033 --> 01:21:27.433
Are you looking for this?

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.667
Wow!

01:21:34.767 --> 01:21:37.333
Wow! I mean really, wow!

01:21:38.033 --> 01:21:42.067
My wife is cheating on me with that poor
guy with a mustache! Wow!

01:21:43.033 --> 01:21:48.300
I'm taking this as meaning
I am not liked by your highness.

01:21:49.433 --> 01:21:52.433
It's 2023. Are you really still talking
like this?

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.533
-Isn't it so ridiculous, bro!
-It's very ridiculous!

01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.667
I really don't know why I am talking
this way.

01:21:58.733 --> 01:22:02.433
This was a trend back in the day
but I don't remember it exactly.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.767
You tried to make your hair look like
mine too, what are you up to?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.700
-Why, is it bad!
-Of course it's bad!

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.233
You are losing your hair.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:14.233
After my matrimony,

01:22:15.133 --> 01:22:21.633
I became an officer at the foundation.
That's when all started.

01:22:22.633 --> 01:22:26.000
Arda, son, can I take it back before
something happens?

01:22:26.067 --> 01:22:27.267
Are you talking about this?

01:22:28.067 --> 01:22:29.267
How does this work, Grandpa?

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:33.567
Something happens when
you lift it like this, right?

01:22:39.133 --> 01:22:44.167
This is great. I was dreaming of this.
I feel great, Grandpa.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.233
-Are you ready, Grandpa?
-More than ready!

01:22:48.567 --> 01:22:50.767
My brother, Mecnun.

01:22:55.233 --> 01:22:58.400
When you go back to your time,
can you go find me and tell me

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:05.333
that I am your best friend?
-Brother Ismail, you are my best friend.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.800
You are a real man, I'm telling you.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.467
I have to be on my way.

01:23:16.233 --> 01:23:19.767
And you please shave that mustache!
What's with that?

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.233
Of course, sir.

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:28.133
Grandpa, are we in our own time?

01:23:28.267 --> 01:23:30.367
-Our time?
-Have we returned to our time

01:23:30.667 --> 01:23:36.633
What are you talking about? We are in
Istanbul, get up already! My back hurts.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:39.533
Grandpa! Your beard! It's back!

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.500
Don't touch my beard! Are you crazy?

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:48.333
I had a terrible nightmare, Grandpa!
It was terrible but it was so real.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:53.133
Grandpa, we were in 2023.
I had a mustache.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.767
A disgusting mustache!

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.633
I you had seen me, I was disgusting.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.633
I was married with three children.

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:03.067
You didn't have your beard or your stick.
You had weird hair.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:09.800
You were building a time machine for us
to get back to the past.

01:24:10.033 --> 01:24:13.200
What! I didn't have a beard?
How did I look?

01:24:13.267 --> 01:24:15.233
-Was I handsome?
-You were. Your face was brighter.

01:24:15.433 --> 01:24:18.400
Well then I will try that.
I will go to a barber.

01:24:18.467 --> 01:24:21.000
Grandpa, please don't.
I love you this way.

01:24:21.067 --> 01:24:23.333
-Let's try it.
-I'm serious. Listen to me.
